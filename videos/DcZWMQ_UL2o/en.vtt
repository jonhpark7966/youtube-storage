WEBVTT

00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:02.068
By the way, I don't have a psychosis.

00:00:02.068 --> 00:00:03.737
I have a Claude complex.

00:00:03.737 --> 00:00:06.039
Why is everyone making that joke? Wait.

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:08.775
Which joke? The psychosis joke.

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:11.778
I thought you were going to be proud of me for saying Claude Complex.

00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:13.279
Oh, that is very good.

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:17.384
I think I do one pun finally for Tracy, and I was over making that joke.

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:19.953
Well, I was thinking that was a joke. I had to go.

00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:22.155
I finally make a pun, and you just jump right over it.

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:26.026
Well, everyone keeps saying that Claude code is I psychosis for smart

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:28.661
people, right? Like, how did that become addictive?

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:29.763
Yeah. All right.

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:31.898
But there's a good. Fun also very bro coded.

00:00:31.898 --> 00:00:34.901
I find.

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:39.239
Hello and

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.242
welcome to another episode of the Odd Lots podcast.

00:00:42.275 --> 00:00:43.443
I'm Joe Weisenthal

00:00:43.443 --> 00:00:46.146
And I'm Tracy Alloway. So, Tracy you're cool.

00:00:46.146 --> 00:00:47.213
Like, if I like,

00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:48.815
you know, just

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:51.951
start doing this part time as I like, build out my software business.

00:00:51.951 --> 00:00:53.219
Right. Like you're cool about that.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.990
I was going to say I've been thinking about AI and productivity.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:00.660
And so far your productivity has gone down, Joe.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.497
So instead of doing all thoughts things, you're coding your own software.

00:01:04.798 --> 00:01:07.500
Except that I'm creating content for the Odd Lots

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.470
newsletter about coding and that is productivity.

00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:11.838
A creative.

00:01:11.838 --> 00:01:13.473
Debatable. Debatable.

00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:15.542
But but you're cool with that.

00:01:15.542 --> 00:01:16.476
You're cool with like me.

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:16.876
Like, oh,

00:01:16.876 --> 00:01:19.879
I'm just going to, like, check in part time on Odd Lots when we have a record.

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:21.147
Well, oh. Of course not.

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:24.050
Okay, good, good, good. That's the right answer. I want you to.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.085
I want you to be really sad.

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:28.088
But like a few other people, you know, I have, like,

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:32.459
caught the sort of, like, bug of, like, AI coding, and I'm totally blown away.

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:34.561
I like, played with it from the beginning.

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:37.664
I started playing around with it last year, but then over the holidays

00:01:37.664 --> 00:01:39.532
and I've been writing about this in the newsletter suddenly, like,

00:01:39.532 --> 00:01:42.535
my Twitter feed is like club code, plug code, plug code

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:46.539
and you just cursor before which I was very impressed by at the time.

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:50.643
And so when I got home from vacation, one of the first things I did

00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:54.147
is like, figure out how to install plug code on my computer.

00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:56.416
And I was like, oh, I am like hooked.

00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:58.651
And this is actually like,

00:01:58.651 --> 00:02:02.255
I see why I have my Twitter feed is just like people posting about this.

00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:02.889
All right.

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:06.226
So I have to say, I have not tried it because I only have

00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:09.229
a work computer and I can't install new software.

00:02:09.362 --> 00:02:12.132
And I probably definitely cannot install

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:15.101
new software that then makes changes to existing software.

00:02:15.502 --> 00:02:17.537
I don't think Bloomberg would like that.

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:19.372
But I have seen the hype.

00:02:19.372 --> 00:02:21.474
Lots of people talking about it.

00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:24.611
Have you seen, Claude Co-work?

00:02:24.944 --> 00:02:26.446
Have you heard of. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:26.446 --> 00:02:30.750
So one of the criticisms of Claude Code was that, you know, like, okay, you code,

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.753
but you still need some background knowledge and coding because,

00:02:33.753 --> 00:02:36.756
like, you know, the interface is kind of like.

00:02:36.756 --> 00:02:42.529
Is. And, and all of that or 1990s, co-work apparently, like, goes

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:48.001
a step further for, for normal people, including it makes it super, super easy.

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:53.306
And the funniest thing is that apparently Claude code actually coded.

00:02:53.373 --> 00:02:54.374
Yeah.

00:02:54.374 --> 00:02:58.044
So the so this is like really relates to my experience last year

00:02:58.044 --> 00:02:59.145
and then this year,

00:02:59.145 --> 00:03:03.149
which is that even last year, like trying to use the AI coding tools,

00:03:03.783 --> 00:03:07.353
it was an annoying process because there were various things

00:03:07.353 --> 00:03:10.356
that you had to do in the actual command line of the computer

00:03:10.657 --> 00:03:13.726
that were like, I didn't, I don't know, command line vernacular.

00:03:13.726 --> 00:03:15.728
And you have to like install these libraries and stuff.

00:03:15.728 --> 00:03:15.962
Yeah.

00:03:15.962 --> 00:03:20.700
So there was this sort of like barrier that existed and

00:03:21.501 --> 00:03:24.571
but what's the what's really changed in the last year

00:03:24.771 --> 00:03:27.607
or with the, with Claude code, which has actually been around for a while

00:03:27.607 --> 00:03:28.741
and I should have like played with it

00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:32.512
before is the like because it sits on your computer.

00:03:32.812 --> 00:03:36.216
It's sort of takes away in deeper access and so when you talk about.

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:37.884
It, it actually does the stuff.

00:03:37.884 --> 00:03:38.251
It does.

00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:39.152
Is it just like,

00:03:39.152 --> 00:03:40.053
oh, it's like, oh, we're

00:03:40.053 --> 00:03:43.756
going to need to install this open source natural language processing library.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.091
It just does it automatically.

00:03:45.091 --> 00:03:46.426
Instead of me trying to like figure out

00:03:46.426 --> 00:03:48.628
like what are the right keystrokes to pull that in or

00:03:48.628 --> 00:03:52.198
why is this not going into the right file folder or whatever.

00:03:52.398 --> 00:03:56.035
And so like, like Co-work, it's like all, like all of these sort

00:03:56.035 --> 00:03:59.205
of like little friction, like these technical things like command

00:03:59.205 --> 00:04:02.742
line use are very rapidly are like dissipating.

00:04:02.742 --> 00:04:03.109
Yeah.

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:05.211
And so that like then you have something like Co-work

00:04:05.211 --> 00:04:07.480
where it's just like they know they're taking care of that.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.483
And so you get this like user interface that's just like

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.352
it's just getting easier and friendlier.

00:04:12.352 --> 00:04:15.555
There's almost no technical frictions at all anymore.

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:19.092
Also, it feels very iterative, like the code is improving upon itself.

00:04:19.125 --> 00:04:19.425
Yeah.

00:04:19.425 --> 00:04:22.128
At this point I think that was one of Claude's main selling points.

00:04:22.128 --> 00:04:26.766
Well, this is like you've seen like people talk about like, oh, is AGI here?

00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:31.371
And this is like part of the debate because one of the ideas, I guess, behind

00:04:31.371 --> 00:04:32.305
AGI is like, well,

00:04:32.305 --> 00:04:35.775
what happens when you have software that can train itself and so forth?

00:04:35.908 --> 00:04:39.712
And I don't really know if I buy that, but you do just see, like how fast

00:04:39.712 --> 00:04:41.214
the iteration cycles are.

00:04:41.214 --> 00:04:44.217
And I think we want to get into this in part,

00:04:44.317 --> 00:04:46.853
they're fast because a bunch of people are suddenly getting excited,

00:04:46.853 --> 00:04:49.322
and then the human provides this sort of like

00:04:49.322 --> 00:04:52.725
we're sowing the seeds of our own demise because we're so enthusiastically

00:04:52.725 --> 00:04:54.794
participating in the evolution.

00:04:54.794 --> 00:04:58.731
But I just like it's suddenly clear, like, oh, this is going to change.

00:04:58.731 --> 00:05:00.366
I think computing.

00:05:00.366 --> 00:05:04.203
And the other thing is the code works like it creates code that like

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.739
this is like there's no bugs. You know, it works.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.109
Did you see speaking of automating yourself?

00:05:10.109 --> 00:05:10.376
Yeah.

00:05:10.376 --> 00:05:13.646
See there was a post on Reddit from a lawyer who said he's basically used

00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:17.283
cloud code to automate, like, his entire job, and he hasn't told anyone.

00:05:17.717 --> 00:05:21.421
I'm not exactly surprised, because the other thing that I experimented with

00:05:22.121 --> 00:05:25.825
is, and I haven't 100% verified this, but on jobs day last week,

00:05:26.392 --> 00:05:30.163
I downloaded the full PDF and I just typed into the cloud code

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:34.200
like find the most interesting details and make some charts based on.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.903
And it did it in like a couple of minutes. I have no like, ability.

00:05:36.903 --> 00:05:41.040
Like I've never like built charts myself and or whatever, or like designer

00:05:41.074 --> 00:05:41.908
or whatever.

00:05:41.908 --> 00:05:44.677
And I didn't totally confirm yet that the data was all correct,

00:05:44.677 --> 00:05:47.447
but I'm pretty sure it was because everything I spot, so I didn't.

00:05:47.447 --> 00:05:49.482
Just that crucial. Detail, I know I didn't.

00:05:49.482 --> 00:05:52.285
That's why I didn't want to like, oh, like, here's what, here's the here's

00:05:52.285 --> 00:05:53.453
jobs report and charts.

00:05:53.453 --> 00:05:54.554
But it might.

00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:57.657
But what application did it actually build it in the charts?

00:05:57.857 --> 00:05:58.358
I don't know.

00:05:58.358 --> 00:05:59.859
I just had a like that's the thing.

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:02.762
I had a file on my computer at that point. What kind of file?

00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:04.831
Like a PNG file.

00:06:04.831 --> 00:06:05.598
Like an image file?

00:06:05.598 --> 00:06:08.101
Yeah, that's the crazy thing, I don't know.

00:06:08.101 --> 00:06:10.770
And so there was just this image that had a bunch of charts, and my spark

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.773
chunks did suggest, like, I didn't see anything off.

00:06:13.773 --> 00:06:17.210
And people get paid money to, like, build that kind of stuff

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.645
for, like, analysts and stuff like that. Right.

00:06:19.645 --> 00:06:21.414
So this is the other big question.

00:06:21.414 --> 00:06:25.551
If everyone can build their own software, what actually happens to software?

00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:26.919
And I was reading something.

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:30.423
I forget who it was by, but someone used cloud code to create.

00:06:30.623 --> 00:06:34.160
They wanted a website that would basically make them money for doing nothing.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.130
And that was the prompt. And did they do? Yeah.

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.733
So the idea that, the model came up with was

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.803
you can sell prompts, packages of good prompts

00:06:43.803 --> 00:06:46.973
and sell them for like 40 bucks and you'll make tons of money.

00:06:47.473 --> 00:06:51.110
And I was thinking about that, like, okay, it's possible to make money that way.

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.881
But also, why wouldn't I just use cloud code. To.

00:06:54.881 --> 00:06:56.783
Do the same thing?

00:06:56.783 --> 00:06:59.152
There are many big questions that we as an economy

00:06:59.152 --> 00:07:00.153
are going to have to think about.

00:07:00.153 --> 00:07:02.388
And I think my main takeaway is we're going to have to

00:07:02.388 --> 00:07:03.956
think about this sooner rather than later.

00:07:03.956 --> 00:07:06.592
But what is cloud code? Why is everyone so hyped about it?

00:07:06.592 --> 00:07:09.996
And what is it about this particular piece of software that versus

00:07:09.996 --> 00:07:13.032
what exists from OpenAI and Gemini and all this stuff?

00:07:13.032 --> 00:07:15.468
Like, why is this captured everyone's imagination?

00:07:15.468 --> 00:07:18.538
We really do have the perfect guys because it's someone who, unlike me,

00:07:19.472 --> 00:07:21.641
has been getting their hands dirty and this stuff for longer.

00:07:21.641 --> 00:07:26.946
One of the few people that I know who is into LMS before ChatGPT existed

00:07:27.079 --> 00:07:31.050
and was actually using them via the API, and was actually talking about

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:36.556
their technical capacity to do things like coding even before November of 2022.

00:07:36.756 --> 00:07:39.192
So truly the perfect guys we're going to be speaking with Noah Brier.

00:07:39.192 --> 00:07:43.029
He's the co-founder of L'échec, a consultancy that helps big companies

00:07:43.196 --> 00:07:44.297
deal with AI stuff.

00:07:44.297 --> 00:07:47.133
So, Noah, thank you so much for coming on, and let's thank.

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:48.401
You for having. Me. What's the deal?

00:07:48.401 --> 00:07:51.804
How are you like using lemons before chat, GPT existed?

00:07:51.804 --> 00:07:54.740
I don't know, I know very few people who were doing that.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:58.578
I had the good fortune of shutting down a startup in 2022,

00:07:58.578 --> 00:08:00.279
and so I had a lot of free time on my hands.

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:01.614
And then how are you using it, though?

00:08:01.614 --> 00:08:04.250
Like how do you look at your like, how did you aware

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:07.153
that there was this thing that could be of potential use to.

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:10.356
So my very first thing I was doing was using GitHub copilot,

00:08:10.356 --> 00:08:15.061
which at the time was built into VS code and it was autocomplete inside VS code.

00:08:15.061 --> 00:08:18.498
So it was a nice and pretty immediately realized that there were certain

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:21.968
coding tasks that it could just handle completely.

00:08:22.835 --> 00:08:24.604
Anything that was very pattern based.

00:08:24.604 --> 00:08:27.306
So if you write code, you write a lot of tests.

00:08:27.306 --> 00:08:30.176
If you write tests, every test kind of follows the same pattern

00:08:30.176 --> 00:08:32.011
and you want it to follow the same pattern, you're

00:08:32.011 --> 00:08:34.413
looking for that structure in and over time,

00:08:34.413 --> 00:08:37.416
because it was looking at your code base, it was able to basically autocomplete it.

00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:41.721
I also started playing with the GPT three API,

00:08:41.954 --> 00:08:44.957
which had come out, I think that came out in November of 2021,

00:08:45.324 --> 00:08:48.361
and that was the first time it was publicly available to everybody.

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:52.899
And they had a large language model as we know it today, available to them.

00:08:52.899 --> 00:08:57.370
So I was just testing and building things, and I pretty immediately

00:08:57.904 --> 00:08:59.572
realized the very first thing I did

00:08:59.572 --> 00:09:02.642
where it just blew my mind, was I built a web scraper.

00:09:02.642 --> 00:09:05.645
So I was I was just trying to pull pricing data from a website.

00:09:05.978 --> 00:09:08.147
And I've done a lot of this in my career.

00:09:08.147 --> 00:09:11.284
It's maybe the most annoying task you have to do in all of coding,

00:09:11.284 --> 00:09:14.287
because HTML is the most miserable language to have to parse.

00:09:14.587 --> 00:09:17.890
And I just had this thing where I took the page, I took the content,

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:21.060
I took the text, and I gave it to the AI, and I asked it to give me back

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:23.663
the pricing table, and it gave me back the pricing table.

00:09:23.663 --> 00:09:26.732
And I just thought, I'll never do it the other way again.

00:09:26.732 --> 00:09:29.268
That's is that HTML mentioned?

00:09:29.268 --> 00:09:33.873
Just brought up like memories of me in like the mid-nineties on HTML.

00:09:33.873 --> 00:09:35.608
Good. Easy to remember that site.

00:09:35.608 --> 00:09:36.275
Yeah.

00:09:36.275 --> 00:09:38.411
I wonder if it's still is it still up?

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:39.245
That would be wild.

00:09:40.846 --> 00:09:42.114
Does clawed code?

00:09:42.114 --> 00:09:43.783
Does that count as AGI?

00:09:43.783 --> 00:09:46.552
This seems to be the debate right? Is it AGI?

00:09:46.552 --> 00:09:49.322
I try not to wade into what's AGI and what's not.

00:09:49.322 --> 00:09:52.291
I think my guess on on AGI, for what it's worth, is that

00:09:52.992 --> 00:09:55.461
it's probably going to be a conversation like the Turing test,

00:09:55.461 --> 00:09:57.496
where everybody thought it was really, really important.

00:09:57.496 --> 00:09:59.298
For a really long time, we thought the Turing test

00:09:59.298 --> 00:10:02.301
was the biggest thing for 70 years or whatever.

00:10:02.301 --> 00:10:04.837
And then.

00:10:04.837 --> 00:10:06.906
ChatGPT very clearly passed the Turing test,

00:10:06.906 --> 00:10:10.076
and now everybody pretends like it's just that they forgot.

00:10:10.109 --> 00:10:11.711
They pretend that it never mattered.

00:10:11.711 --> 00:10:16.148
Oh, and so I am kind of guessing that that's going to be

00:10:16.148 --> 00:10:17.149
what the conversation is like.

00:10:17.149 --> 00:10:19.952
It's just going to be a sort of forever moving goalpost.

00:10:19.952 --> 00:10:22.321
Because it turns out that the idea we had for what

00:10:22.321 --> 00:10:25.791
general intelligence looks like is not quite that.

00:10:26.225 --> 00:10:30.463
But I also think, you know, the computer scientists and the sort of serious

00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:34.333
AI researchers would say that much of what's going on inside cloud

00:10:34.333 --> 00:10:38.070
code is not the model itself, it's the model paired with a human.

00:10:38.504 --> 00:10:41.240
And I think that is a pretty important distinction.

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:42.842
But I don't know about AGI.

00:10:42.842 --> 00:10:49.148
Well, okay, so you were using, GPT to code prior to the release of ChatGPT.

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:53.019
So therefore coding models have been around a long time.

00:10:53.352 --> 00:10:56.656
So what is for those who haven't played or played around with it.

00:10:56.722 --> 00:10:58.157
What is Claude code?

00:10:58.157 --> 00:11:01.160
Because again, coding models have been around for a long time.

00:11:01.227 --> 00:11:04.330
If people maybe have heard of cursor Copilot

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:07.600
or some of these other harnesses, etc., what is cloud code?

00:11:07.733 --> 00:11:11.837
So if we back up first and we go to copilot because so copilot

00:11:11.837 --> 00:11:15.541
was the first sort of commercial application of a large language model.

00:11:16.742 --> 00:11:17.843
By most accounts.

00:11:17.843 --> 00:11:21.447
And what copilot did in its initial instantiation was just.

00:11:21.447 --> 00:11:23.516
Auto some Microsoft. Product. It's a Microsoft product.

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:26.519
So Microsoft owns GitHub, GitHub developer Copilot.

00:11:27.319 --> 00:11:30.289
It was Microsoft had the partnership with OpenAI.

00:11:30.289 --> 00:11:33.559
And so they built it in and what it was doing was doing autocomplete.

00:11:33.559 --> 00:11:35.127
So if you're writing code,

00:11:35.127 --> 00:11:39.265
a lot of writing code is boilerplate or trying to remember the name of a function.

00:11:39.498 --> 00:11:42.068
And, you know, the reason StackOverflow existed

00:11:42.068 --> 00:11:45.071
was because you can never remember the exact name of that function or,

00:11:45.104 --> 00:11:50.042
or the exact regex that you need to use in order to find and replace something.

00:11:50.309 --> 00:11:52.445
And so you would go search for it.

00:11:52.445 --> 00:11:55.548
And they realized that you could just build that into the IDE,

00:11:56.449 --> 00:11:59.251
your code editor and, and have it autocomplete for you.

00:11:59.251 --> 00:12:01.454
And it was pretty amazing. Yeah.

00:12:02.455 --> 00:12:04.123
Then,

00:12:04.123 --> 00:12:07.960
ChatGPT came out, and even before that, I had built a simple chat bot for myself

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.128
because I realized that, hey,

00:12:09.128 --> 00:12:12.131
I could just ask this and instead of going and searching StackOverflow,

00:12:12.298 --> 00:12:15.601
it was totally capable of answering code questions,

00:12:15.601 --> 00:12:17.970
and it was capable of writing regex or doing these things.

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:19.338
And did it make mistakes? Yes.

00:12:19.338 --> 00:12:23.142
But like there's famous mistakes on StackOverflow of incorrect regex

00:12:23.142 --> 00:12:26.145
that now exists in every codebase in the world.

00:12:26.712 --> 00:12:28.581
And so, you know, there were a lot of us

00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:32.218
just kind of playing with these things and realizing they were a huge boon.

00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:35.888
And so I think really the next step is Curser comes out.

00:12:35.888 --> 00:12:39.625
And the thing is to realize that copilot didn't was that it wasn't good enough

00:12:39.658 --> 00:12:40.392
to have autocomplete.

00:12:40.392 --> 00:12:41.794
You also needed the Q&A

00:12:41.794 --> 00:12:44.663
because you have these things that you can't just autocomplete.

00:12:44.663 --> 00:12:46.265
You want to be able to ask the question and answer it.

00:12:46.265 --> 00:12:49.335
And then ChatGPT came out and everybody was switching between idea.

00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:54.540
And then I think really the next big piece is that cloud code came out,

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:56.909
and what Cloud Code did that was so remarkable

00:12:56.909 --> 00:12:59.912
was they took the same set of models, really.

00:13:00.513 --> 00:13:03.582
And they took them out of the chat bot and they really just gave it

00:13:03.582 --> 00:13:08.854
some very basic functionality to operate within your machine.

00:13:08.854 --> 00:13:09.155
Right.

00:13:09.155 --> 00:13:12.158
And so, you know, if you really look at kind of what exists within cloud code,

00:13:12.424 --> 00:13:15.427
you're calling out to a model and they gave it capability around

00:13:15.427 --> 00:13:16.562
sort of two big things.

00:13:16.562 --> 00:13:19.532
One is you can read and write files on your computer.

00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:23.035
And then two is that you can operate Unix.

00:13:23.035 --> 00:13:27.540
The, the base commands, the bash commands that exist in your environment.

00:13:28.541 --> 00:13:32.077
And again, because these models were trained on the internet

00:13:32.077 --> 00:13:34.046
and there's no greater source of information

00:13:34.046 --> 00:13:36.048
on the internet than how to make the internet,

00:13:36.048 --> 00:13:39.752
they know how to use Unix commands incredibly well.

00:13:39.752 --> 00:13:42.688
Right? Because Unix has existed for whatever it is 60 years.

00:13:42.688 --> 00:13:45.724
And the way these commands were designed, they're all designed to be very,

00:13:45.724 --> 00:13:46.392
very simple.

00:13:46.392 --> 00:13:47.726
There's a find command

00:13:47.726 --> 00:13:50.830
and, you know, there's a thing called grep and it can search to a code base.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:55.267
And Unix has this sort of beautiful way of tying one command to another

00:13:55.267 --> 00:13:58.270
so you can take the output of one command and send it to another.

00:13:58.437 --> 00:14:02.842
And they kind of just gave the model access to these 2 or 3 very simple things.

00:14:03.375 --> 00:14:06.979
And it kind of turned out that it unlocked a whole bunch of functionality

00:14:06.979 --> 00:14:10.449
that I don't think even the people who built it fully realized.

00:14:10.449 --> 00:14:14.787
Like one example that I think about a lot is just the challenge

00:14:14.787 --> 00:14:18.924
you have with all of these AI models is that they're stateless.

00:14:19.091 --> 00:14:24.463
So every time you talk to ChatGPT, it's sending your entire conversation history

00:14:24.463 --> 00:14:28.901
back to ChatGPT because it has no saved history of that chat.

00:14:28.901 --> 00:14:31.370
Right? And that's fine. It's the way it works.

00:14:31.370 --> 00:14:34.540
It just fact, but it means that, you know, it forgets things.

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:38.077
It doesn't know conversation, a conversation and one

00:14:38.077 --> 00:14:41.513
very easy way to save your state is just write it to a file.

00:14:42.781 --> 00:14:43.382
And so

00:14:43.382 --> 00:14:46.518
you give it right access and it can create files.

00:14:46.518 --> 00:14:50.222
And now all of a sudden you've overcome this like probably

00:14:50.222 --> 00:14:53.592
the single biggest challenge that exists inside these large

00:14:53.592 --> 00:14:56.595
language models, which is that they're fundamentally stateless.

00:14:56.896 --> 00:15:00.266
So Claude writes itself little like memory notes, right,

00:15:00.266 --> 00:15:03.302
to to remember the entire context of the conversation.

00:15:03.702 --> 00:15:05.271
And that's how it solved that problem.

00:15:05.271 --> 00:15:09.275
No. So there's sort of two things going on in cloud code beneath the hood.

00:15:09.541 --> 00:15:12.811
There's one thing that works exactly like ChatGPT or any of these other ones,

00:15:12.878 --> 00:15:15.214
which is it's maintaining a conversation history.

00:15:15.214 --> 00:15:18.284
So every message you send it and every,

00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:22.321
action, it takes, it's recording to a log.

00:15:22.321 --> 00:15:22.922
Right.

00:15:22.922 --> 00:15:27.359
Which is just one big file that's really no different than what ChatGPT can do.

00:15:27.526 --> 00:15:29.094
Where it gets really interesting,

00:15:29.094 --> 00:15:32.665
though, is it can also write files that it can then read.

00:15:33.132 --> 00:15:37.002
So whereas that conversation history is all saved off

00:15:37.002 --> 00:15:38.904
and eventually that conversation gets too long

00:15:38.904 --> 00:15:40.839
and it needs to do a thing called compaction.

00:15:40.839 --> 00:15:44.810
And when it compacts it, it tries to sort of just remember the bits

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:47.947
because there the total window is, is, is

00:15:49.248 --> 00:15:49.748
large.

00:15:49.748 --> 00:15:52.151
But I mean, it's like 100,000 tokens.

00:15:52.151 --> 00:15:54.053
So that's what I mean by memory notes. Right?

00:15:54.053 --> 00:15:57.256
It compacts the information into the important stuff.

00:15:57.423 --> 00:15:59.725
So it doesn't retrieve. It does that.

00:15:59.725 --> 00:16:01.160
It only does that at the end.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.128
Like once it runs out of space, okay.

00:16:03.128 --> 00:16:04.830
Once it runs out of context window.

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:08.267
So it has 200,000 tokens, I think, and 200,000 tokens in rough

00:16:08.267 --> 00:16:11.270
terms is probably 150,000 words.

00:16:11.403 --> 00:16:15.207
It says, okay, it's time for me to compact all of this stuff.

00:16:15.374 --> 00:16:18.610
And so it still saves your whole history on your computer.

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:20.212
You still have the entire message.

00:16:20.212 --> 00:16:24.083
But for that session, it just compacts it down to this, you know,

00:16:24.683 --> 00:16:29.321
maybe 25,000 token memory. 25.

00:16:29.321 --> 00:16:31.357
What it was. Yeah.

00:16:31.357 --> 00:16:33.792
And is this, like something that was not obvious

00:16:33.792 --> 00:16:37.162
before as a solution like this compaction.

00:16:37.162 --> 00:16:40.666
How important is it for this being like,

00:16:41.033 --> 00:16:44.636
okay, as a human, I can work on this on a project for a long time.

00:16:44.636 --> 00:16:47.139
Like how much of an unlock was there?

00:16:47.139 --> 00:16:49.341
I'm not sure compaction was the okay.

00:16:49.341 --> 00:16:52.511
I think the compaction functionality is helpful.

00:16:52.511 --> 00:16:53.078
Okay.

00:16:53.078 --> 00:16:55.014
The way ChatGPT does it for what it's worth is

00:16:55.014 --> 00:16:58.117
they don't do compaction, they just forget your messages eventually.

00:16:58.117 --> 00:17:02.021
So if you're in one chat, eventually your oldest message is going

00:17:02.021 --> 00:17:03.088
to fall off the back.

00:17:04.123 --> 00:17:05.124
For coding,

00:17:05.124 --> 00:17:08.627
that's probably less helpful, but there are trade offs.

00:17:08.627 --> 00:17:10.262
I have both techniques work.

00:17:10.262 --> 00:17:11.730
I think fundamentally

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:14.833
the thing that is special about cloud code is not the compaction,

00:17:15.134 --> 00:17:19.271
it's the it's the ability to write and read files on your computer.

00:17:19.304 --> 00:17:21.840
Yeah. Which means you can always write off memories.

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:23.609
And then what does that mean? Right off memory.

00:17:23.609 --> 00:17:25.177
So you could say, hey,

00:17:25.177 --> 00:17:28.080
I it's really important that I remember this thing for future sessions.

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:29.448
I want to always work this way.

00:17:29.448 --> 00:17:32.451
So in a code base of mine,

00:17:32.584 --> 00:17:35.254
I have a set of documentation

00:17:35.254 --> 00:17:39.191
that explains how I like to do things, and cloud code makes a mistake.

00:17:39.191 --> 00:17:39.958
And so the next time

00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:44.263
I can write a memory, essentially it's written as a thing they call a skill.

00:17:44.963 --> 00:17:48.033
And you can write it off and you say, hey, whenever you run into this,

00:17:48.033 --> 00:17:50.102
I want you to operate in this kind of way.

00:17:50.102 --> 00:17:53.372
And that existing across every session

00:17:53.705 --> 00:17:57.576
is really a thing you can only do when you can store it as a file.

00:17:57.609 --> 00:18:00.746
Yeah, it's a thing you can't do in quite the same way when you're

00:18:00.746 --> 00:18:03.816
operating in this environment where it's just going back and forth to the API.

00:18:03.816 --> 00:18:07.352
So this access to the file system is one really big piece.

00:18:07.352 --> 00:18:10.355
And then the second is, is just the Unix commands, I mean

00:18:10.622 --> 00:18:13.192
computers, every computer program

00:18:13.192 --> 00:18:17.196
lives on top of the sort of baseline functions.

00:18:17.463 --> 00:18:20.432
And the way that the designers of Unix

00:18:20.432 --> 00:18:24.269
built them is really elegant and they're very small.

00:18:24.269 --> 00:18:27.506
They all do one thing and they're all composable.

00:18:27.506 --> 00:18:27.840
And in

00:18:28.841 --> 00:18:31.877
coding terms, composable means they can be they can be chained together.

00:18:31.877 --> 00:18:32.111
Right.

00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:37.049
And so you can say, hey, look for files that mention this word

00:18:37.049 --> 00:18:40.552
and then from those files, I want you to take this second action.

00:18:40.552 --> 00:18:43.422
And then from the output of that action, I want you to take a third action.

00:18:43.422 --> 00:18:45.124
And that's just built into Unix.

00:18:45.124 --> 00:18:45.591
You literally

00:18:45.591 --> 00:18:49.428
just put a little pipe in between and you just pipe them from one to another

00:18:49.428 --> 00:18:50.395
and, and that's it.

00:18:50.395 --> 00:18:51.296
And so

00:18:51.296 --> 00:18:52.264
you give it access

00:18:52.264 --> 00:18:53.699
to write these commands, and all of a sudden

00:18:53.699 --> 00:18:56.101
it gets these sort of second and third order effects

00:18:56.101 --> 00:18:59.872
that are just incredibly powerful and built over a really long time.

00:18:59.872 --> 00:19:03.809
So how much of Claude code, the way it's different to other models,

00:19:03.809 --> 00:19:07.112
how much of that was overcoming technological challenges versus

00:19:07.112 --> 00:19:11.116
like just having a good idea because hearing you describe it,

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:15.654
I mean, giving access to a computer seems like kind of obvious.

00:19:15.654 --> 00:19:17.556
Like, let's, let's just do that.

00:19:19.224 --> 00:19:20.559
I don't have a good answer to that.

00:19:20.559 --> 00:19:23.295
I think that it was kind of just a good idea.

00:19:23.295 --> 00:19:25.797
Yeah. I think they did some patterns really well.

00:19:25.797 --> 00:19:28.200
They're clearly incredibly talented,

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:32.571
not just engineers, but kind of thinkers about how to structure it.

00:19:32.571 --> 00:19:36.175
Like, the, the primitives inside called code are just smart.

00:19:36.341 --> 00:19:40.646
And then the thing that they've done and Boris Cherny, who's the,

00:19:41.547 --> 00:19:46.185
lead developer on cloud coded anthropic, he talks about, latent demand a lot.

00:19:46.251 --> 00:19:46.485
Right.

00:19:46.485 --> 00:19:49.555
And latent demand is basically just, hey, look at the ways people are using

00:19:49.555 --> 00:19:53.192
these systems and then figure out ways to make that a part of the product itself.

00:19:53.492 --> 00:19:57.062
I think what they've done brilliantly, and this is kind of easy when you have

00:19:57.062 --> 00:20:00.065
a community of developers who are nerds, who want to go talk about all the ways

00:20:00.065 --> 00:20:02.668
that they're using these things, is they have.

00:20:02.668 --> 00:20:06.271
I am amazed at the speed in which, you know, I have a small community

00:20:06.271 --> 00:20:09.675
of 15 CTOs who all use this stuff religiously.

00:20:09.675 --> 00:20:12.244
And, you know, when we first started that community,

00:20:12.244 --> 00:20:15.013
it took them a month to I would see it in the chat,

00:20:15.013 --> 00:20:17.549
and then a month later, it would get built into cloud code.

00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:19.651
And then increasingly like it's like a day later,

00:20:19.651 --> 00:20:21.520
it feels like they're just they're just listening to it.

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:25.357
But I think they're just not only tapped in, but they're really fundamentally,

00:20:25.824 --> 00:20:27.359
you know, they're they're dog fooding.

00:20:27.359 --> 00:20:30.429
They use their own products when you, you know,

00:20:30.429 --> 00:20:33.765
they talk about the productivity engineering, productivity at anthropic.

00:20:34.399 --> 00:20:38.270
You know, despite growing at a crazy clip, it continues to go up.

00:20:38.337 --> 00:20:42.841
And, you know, anybody who's built had to manage large scale

00:20:43.675 --> 00:20:47.846
pieces of software, large scale codebases knows that's not the norm.

00:20:48.313 --> 00:20:52.651
So vs code and cursor, these are ideas.

00:20:53.685 --> 00:20:56.722
Cloud code is not an ID, it's a CLI.

00:20:56.888 --> 00:20:58.557
A clear command line interface.

00:20:58.557 --> 00:20:58.924
Got it.

00:20:58.924 --> 00:21:02.027
And the other labs now they also have close.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:06.265
So why are we all talk about cloud code and AI charging.

00:21:06.265 --> 00:21:07.833
Because users are called Codex.

00:21:07.833 --> 00:21:10.402
I don't know what Gemini's is called. I think it's just called the gem.

00:21:10.402 --> 00:21:10.936
Okay, so.

00:21:10.936 --> 00:21:15.307
Why are we all talk about cloud code rather than the other classes

00:21:15.307 --> 00:21:18.243
that kind of have the same thing? Like what is the difference?

00:21:18.243 --> 00:21:19.945
I think first and foremost they were first.

00:21:19.945 --> 00:21:22.681
Okay. So and I think they've they've had a lot more.

00:21:22.681 --> 00:21:26.585
And you know, from my very personal opinion, I think they've

00:21:26.918 --> 00:21:31.256
done some things smarter and better as far as the Permissioning models.

00:21:31.256 --> 00:21:32.724
So, you know, one of the really dangerous

00:21:32.724 --> 00:21:34.459
things is you've got this thing running on your computer.

00:21:34.459 --> 00:21:36.161
You don't want it to go and delete everything.

00:21:36.161 --> 00:21:36.495
Right?

00:21:36.495 --> 00:21:40.399
And, they have a very fine grained permissioning model

00:21:40.399 --> 00:21:42.801
where you can say, hey, I want to allow this just this one time.

00:21:42.801 --> 00:21:44.002
I want to always allow it.

00:21:44.002 --> 00:21:46.738
You know. I always click, always allow. I living on the edge.

00:21:46.738 --> 00:21:49.241
You can, you can, next time you run it,

00:21:49.241 --> 00:21:52.411
you can just do a flag that says dangerously skip permissions.

00:21:53.178 --> 00:21:55.580
And and it'll just, they call it yolo mode.

00:21:56.948 --> 00:21:57.849
I think

00:21:57.849 --> 00:22:02.821
I think more fundamentally, though, if I look at at Codex versus Cloud Code,

00:22:02.821 --> 00:22:06.992
I think it's, a difference in philosophy around what you want.

00:22:06.992 --> 00:22:08.527
AI to do.

00:22:08.527 --> 00:22:14.032
To me, Codex, which is excellent, is very focused on

00:22:14.232 --> 00:22:18.236
building an agent that you can just give something to and it'll just go do it.

00:22:18.503 --> 00:22:19.971
So I want to give it that task.

00:22:19.971 --> 00:22:21.273
I don't want to intercede.

00:22:21.273 --> 00:22:23.275
I don't want to give it any more feedback.

00:22:23.275 --> 00:22:25.877
And cloud code

00:22:25.877 --> 00:22:30.082
is much more designed to be, kind of a pair programmer.

00:22:30.215 --> 00:22:33.418
And so, you know, in engineering, pair programing has existed for a while.

00:22:33.585 --> 00:22:36.188
It's a really weird sort of productivity thing

00:22:36.188 --> 00:22:39.191
where you put two engineers on the same problem and it turns out

00:22:39.324 --> 00:22:42.160
that you can get better code and worse, multiply.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:42.427
Yeah.

00:22:42.427 --> 00:22:45.430
And it sort of makes up for the fact that obviously, you know, you're

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:48.433
doubling the staff on it, but because of how many fewer bugs

00:22:48.433 --> 00:22:51.737
because you have both sets of eyes, it it has seemed to work out for many folks.

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:53.872
Most companies don't practice it.

00:22:53.872 --> 00:22:58.610
But I think cloud code fundamentally is much more designed in that way.

00:22:58.610 --> 00:22:59.478
It's a pair programmer.

00:22:59.478 --> 00:23:03.882
It's, they, you know, whenever I start a project, I start in plan mode.

00:23:03.882 --> 00:23:05.784
So you start in plan mode, you put together a plan.

00:23:05.784 --> 00:23:07.753
I really I mean, I spend a lot of time in plan mode.

00:23:07.753 --> 00:23:10.122
You go through you, it gives you a plan back.

00:23:10.122 --> 00:23:11.223
It asks you how you feel.

00:23:11.223 --> 00:23:13.358
You can give it a whole bunch of direction,

00:23:13.358 --> 00:23:16.661
and then it's only then that it goes off and it goes into it.

00:23:16.695 --> 00:23:19.831
So, you know, we're working together and I actually have a whole system now

00:23:19.831 --> 00:23:20.832
that I've designed where,

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.436
I use a task management system called linear.

00:23:24.436 --> 00:23:27.205
So I have quad code write tasks off to linear.

00:23:27.205 --> 00:23:32.177
And then I've worked, with cloud code to write a document that helps

00:23:32.177 --> 00:23:34.246
sort of decide a set of heuristics to decide

00:23:34.246 --> 00:23:37.716
when you should assign it to Codex versus when you should give it to cloud code.

00:23:37.916 --> 00:23:39.384
And so if it's tightly defined enough

00:23:39.384 --> 00:23:41.219
and simple enough, I just send it off to Codex.

00:23:41.219 --> 00:23:43.288
And it does it totally independently.

00:23:43.288 --> 00:23:46.591
And then if it's complicated enough that I think it requires

00:23:46.591 --> 00:23:52.597
my time and attention, then it it saves it for me, us to do together.

00:23:53.331 --> 00:23:55.200
And we'll work on it together.

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.602
And so if it's, it's sort of touching,

00:23:57.602 --> 00:24:00.939
kind of important enough if it's changing some part of the data model,

00:24:01.173 --> 00:24:02.407
there's these other kind of,

00:24:02.407 --> 00:24:05.043
you know, fairly basic set of criteria that I use. And,

00:24:06.278 --> 00:24:08.580
but that to me is the fundamental distinction.

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:14.419
And, you know, I find cloud code in that way to be just in it

00:24:14.453 --> 00:24:18.123
sort of fits what I want to do and how I want to work.

00:24:18.824 --> 00:24:19.858
Much better.

00:24:19.858 --> 00:24:24.496
Talk a little bit more about how it actually impacts the workflow

00:24:24.496 --> 00:24:30.168
of an engineer, because, you know, my impression was people can code, right?

00:24:30.168 --> 00:24:33.572
Like the coding problem is kind of solved at this point.

00:24:33.572 --> 00:24:36.741
And even if you can't code, even if you're not a professional engineer,

00:24:36.975 --> 00:24:40.712
you can hire someone from like India or Indonesia

00:24:40.712 --> 00:24:42.414
or wherever to just write you a code.

00:24:42.414 --> 00:24:46.318
Maybe it'll take them a week instead of like two days with cloud code.

00:24:46.518 --> 00:24:49.788
But how much does this actually change

00:24:50.555 --> 00:24:53.091
the workflow for an engineer?

00:24:53.091 --> 00:24:55.293
As completely as it could be changed.

00:24:55.293 --> 00:24:58.296
I mean, I would say that over the last three months

00:24:59.097 --> 00:25:02.033
I've written personally,

00:25:02.033 --> 00:25:05.937
I don't know, a few hundred lines of code, like, I, I am mostly

00:25:05.937 --> 00:25:10.575
a manager of a set of agents who are writing code on my behalf.

00:25:10.575 --> 00:25:13.211
And, you know, increasingly, what I think is interesting,

00:25:13.211 --> 00:25:15.947
I've been thinking about this bunch lately is like,

00:25:15.947 --> 00:25:18.550
in some ways, it's just bringing me back to the core challenge

00:25:18.550 --> 00:25:22.754
that has always existed in software development, which is how do you manage,

00:25:23.488 --> 00:25:26.124
large scale software development projects?

00:25:26.124 --> 00:25:27.459
Coordination. Right.

00:25:27.459 --> 00:25:29.160
It has become a coordination problem.

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:33.532
And, and I spent a lot of time sort of now designing

00:25:34.399 --> 00:25:37.669
my cloud code system to ensure that code goes through

00:25:37.669 --> 00:25:41.373
all the proper checks and that it it has all these things.

00:25:41.506 --> 00:25:45.944
The other thing that, you know, makes code a particularly good place to do this

00:25:45.977 --> 00:25:50.448
is that code is verifiable in a way that, you know, most other work is not.

00:25:50.615 --> 00:25:55.186
So, you know, with code, you can verify that the build works, right?

00:25:55.186 --> 00:25:58.323
So you can say, hey, I want to build this, I want to build this package.

00:25:58.323 --> 00:25:59.858
I want to make sure that it's actually going to build

00:25:59.858 --> 00:26:01.293
and that there's not going to be no failures.

00:26:01.293 --> 00:26:04.229
That's a very easy check. It's either true or it's not true.

00:26:04.229 --> 00:26:07.933
There's also coders use linting.

00:26:07.933 --> 00:26:12.537
And so linting is a way to kind of look it's static code analysis.

00:26:12.537 --> 00:26:14.873
So it basically tries to sort of find,

00:26:17.442 --> 00:26:20.478
things in your code base that are not going to work ahead of time,

00:26:20.645 --> 00:26:25.250
where you can predict that obviously, you can't predict, Alan Turing, proved

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:28.253
that you can't predict, with certainty whether code is going to run.

00:26:28.253 --> 00:26:30.455
But there are certain patterns and things that it can find.

00:26:30.455 --> 00:26:32.891
It's essentially does static pattern analysis.

00:26:32.891 --> 00:26:35.894
And, so, you know, you haven't run all these things, but,

00:26:36.428 --> 00:26:39.664
the more kind of opinionated you can be about that

00:26:39.664 --> 00:26:41.099
and the more steps you can have a go through.

00:26:41.099 --> 00:26:42.133
So I find, you know,

00:26:42.133 --> 00:26:45.170
now I'm kind of the designer, which honestly, as an entrepreneur

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:48.840
and as a CEO of companies like that's kind of always been my job.

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:52.677
Like I've been up not I have less and less been a person who writes code.

00:26:52.677 --> 00:26:54.980
And more and more I've been a person who designs

00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:58.416
a system, in that case, a company with a bunch of people who write code.

00:26:59.684 --> 00:27:01.219
One of the funny things it

00:27:01.219 --> 00:27:04.856
seems to me is that setting aside clawed code

00:27:05.023 --> 00:27:08.360
code itself has a reputation for.

00:27:08.727 --> 00:27:11.763
It's a nicer chat bot to talk to people, find it,

00:27:12.998 --> 00:27:16.534
you know, ChatGPT seems to really be sycophantic.

00:27:16.534 --> 00:27:17.535
I still think it's.

00:27:17.535 --> 00:27:19.838
I know it's improved, but I actually don't think it's improved enough.

00:27:19.838 --> 00:27:20.505
It's still.

00:27:20.505 --> 00:27:24.643
People like the prose style of, claw clawed.

00:27:24.843 --> 00:27:28.546
And I'm curious that in the pair trading, pair trading,

00:27:28.546 --> 00:27:31.549
I'm thinking about finance, the peer engineering model,

00:27:31.683 --> 00:27:36.321
whether there is also an edge there, which is like here is a chat bot

00:27:36.421 --> 00:27:39.391
that is not annoying to talk to while you're iterating,

00:27:39.391 --> 00:27:42.761
and whether that is like a meaningful distinction between,

00:27:43.395 --> 00:27:46.097
you know, coding with Codex or whatever.

00:27:46.097 --> 00:27:50.969
Yeah, I, I don't know, I it still can be very annoying, I can tell you.

00:27:50.969 --> 00:27:55.106
And it'll still sometimes, be overly,

00:27:56.708 --> 00:27:59.310
overly effusive with me about a design choice

00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:02.947
I made or sort of noticed something, which I could live without.

00:28:02.981 --> 00:28:06.751
I so I'm working on this project that's, doing this linguistic things,

00:28:06.951 --> 00:28:09.954
and I eventually had to say, like, give it to me straight.

00:28:09.954 --> 00:28:11.056
How bad is this?

00:28:11.056 --> 00:28:14.359
And then so I said, I said, actually, what I said was and assume

00:28:14.359 --> 00:28:17.362
for a moment that you are a quantitative linguistics for the PhD.

00:28:17.762 --> 00:28:20.732
Give me your honest assessment of where we are with this.

00:28:21.066 --> 00:28:23.702
And it said, like you've developed

00:28:23.702 --> 00:28:27.105
a nice toy and there's no evidence that it actually does.

00:28:27.105 --> 00:28:28.873
And I was like, okay, that's nice to hear.

00:28:28.873 --> 00:28:30.875
I actually like I, you know, I appreciate that.

00:28:30.875 --> 00:28:34.612
And it was like a very blunt, no, you know, it's still like polite,

00:28:34.713 --> 00:28:37.682
but it was like, this does it you do have a really showing anything

00:28:37.682 --> 00:28:40.652
you haven't really established at all that your software does what it claims to.

00:28:40.752 --> 00:28:42.487
Yeah, I think so.

00:28:42.487 --> 00:28:45.790
I think stylistically I kind of personally agree.

00:28:45.790 --> 00:28:49.160
I my theory, by the way on on Claude versus

00:28:50.228 --> 00:28:52.230
OpenAI ChatGPT models is

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:56.334
I think Claude is actually better at sort of reflecting what you give it.

00:28:56.935 --> 00:28:58.403
And so I think part of why we think

00:28:58.403 --> 00:29:01.506
it's better is it it's better at pretending it's us.

00:29:01.506 --> 00:29:01.840
Yeah.

00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:05.510
And so we tend to like that is this is purely, speculation.

00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:07.045
But that's always been my theory on.

00:29:07.045 --> 00:29:09.013
On to flatters you in a different. Way.

00:29:09.013 --> 00:29:10.982
I think it's flattering you in a much.

00:29:10.982 --> 00:29:13.284
More subtle way. Yeah. Interesting.

00:29:13.284 --> 00:29:16.287
But, for a long time, just,

00:29:16.821 --> 00:29:19.691
anthropic has been producing the best coding models, you know?

00:29:19.691 --> 00:29:22.694
I mean, there's there can be some debate there now, but,

00:29:23.294 --> 00:29:24.496
you know, there's a great story

00:29:24.496 --> 00:29:28.566
from cursor, actually, where cursor basically wasn't that good.

00:29:28.566 --> 00:29:31.569
And then sonnet 3.5 came out and all of a sudden

00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:35.940
cursor was amazing and cursor became a tool that everybody started using.

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:36.508
But it wasn't

00:29:36.508 --> 00:29:39.410
until this other model came out and they made that the default model.

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:41.646
And, you know, I for what it's worth,

00:29:41.646 --> 00:29:44.649
I think the other takeaway from that, which is a kind of big theme

00:29:45.283 --> 00:29:49.154
we see in the market, is the thing that, the Cloud Code team has talked about is,

00:29:49.721 --> 00:29:52.991
you just constantly have to be building ahead with AI in a way

00:29:52.991 --> 00:29:56.394
that is very unique in the world of software,

00:29:56.394 --> 00:30:01.266
where you kind of always want to build things that are working at like 70 or 80%,

00:30:01.266 --> 00:30:04.636
because if you really spend the time to get it up to 90 or 100,

00:30:04.836 --> 00:30:07.839
you're going to lose all the gains you get when the next model comes out.

00:30:07.972 --> 00:30:11.276
And the, you know, with the amount of CapEx being spent at these models,

00:30:11.276 --> 00:30:13.545
like there's a next model that's going to come out,

00:30:13.545 --> 00:30:15.246
that's going to be awesome, and you just kind of

00:30:15.246 --> 00:30:18.416
want to be downstream from that, and you don't want to waste six months

00:30:18.416 --> 00:30:22.287
getting an extra 3% when that new model is going to give you an extra seven.

00:30:23.154 --> 00:30:23.388
Yeah.

00:30:23.388 --> 00:30:26.457
This is the only certainty with AI is like, there's always going to be

00:30:26.457 --> 00:30:27.091
a new model.

00:30:27.091 --> 00:30:30.195
It's the worst model ever used is the one that we're using.

00:30:30.428 --> 00:30:32.130
That's right, that's right.

00:30:32.130 --> 00:30:35.133
Are we all going to become coding illiterate?

00:30:35.166 --> 00:30:38.503
Are we just going to forget how to code if everyone's using, you know,

00:30:38.703 --> 00:30:41.206
general language. To forget I never learned.

00:30:41.206 --> 00:30:43.708
Yeah, okay. You know what I've been thinking about? You know that,

00:30:45.276 --> 00:30:47.478
Scott Karp, the, CEO of Palantir.

00:30:47.478 --> 00:30:49.714
He has that line. He's like, when I was young,

00:30:49.714 --> 00:30:52.150
I was too poor to have a car or so I didn't get a.

00:30:52.150 --> 00:30:53.418
So I never learned to drive.

00:30:53.418 --> 00:30:55.820
And now I'm too rich. So I never learned to drive.

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:58.890
I feel like when I was young, I was too dumb to learn to code.

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:00.992
And now. You leaped. Ahead.

00:31:00.992 --> 00:31:01.226
Yeah.

00:31:01.226 --> 00:31:04.229
No, I'm too smart to learn Python or HTML or whatever.

00:31:04.963 --> 00:31:07.465
I have a couple of takes on this one personally.

00:31:07.465 --> 00:31:10.468
So, the first one is I just think like

00:31:10.935 --> 00:31:13.137
this is the worry of all technology ever.

00:31:13.137 --> 00:31:17.041
There was a paper that came out that showed that people were,

00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:20.345
you know, they were forgetting more things or something

00:31:20.345 --> 00:31:22.247
because they were using ChatGPT. But, you know,

00:31:23.248 --> 00:31:25.383
in Phaedrus, Plato was worried

00:31:25.383 --> 00:31:29.020
that people were going to forget things because they started writing things down.

00:31:29.487 --> 00:31:31.689
And, you know, I think the trade off there was pretty good.

00:31:31.689 --> 00:31:34.692
We got this scientific revolution, a couple other things. So,

00:31:35.927 --> 00:31:38.930
you know, I think that's the sort of natural kneejerk.

00:31:40.198 --> 00:31:42.433
With that said, it is

00:31:42.433 --> 00:31:45.970
I it's very strange when you have people,

00:31:46.471 --> 00:31:49.474
you know, the Cloud code team is talking about how little code they write.

00:31:50.041 --> 00:31:54.078
Now, I draw a distinction in between the sort of vibe coding

00:31:54.078 --> 00:31:57.916
and the kind of amateur people who have never written code.

00:31:57.916 --> 00:32:00.151
And I think that is amazing, by the way.

00:32:00.151 --> 00:32:03.988
And I think, there's a lot of software developers who are really mad about that,

00:32:04.355 --> 00:32:07.959
because they're, they, they claim it's for safety reasons or whatever.

00:32:07.959 --> 00:32:10.261
But I think fundamentally it's just they've got people on their turf.

00:32:11.562 --> 00:32:12.997
But I think that's incredible.

00:32:12.997 --> 00:32:17.735
I mean, my, I, my, my nine year old, vibe coded a website.

00:32:18.303 --> 00:32:20.838
Oh, wow. And, for secrets. Santa.

00:32:20.838 --> 00:32:21.773
She's now ten.

00:32:21.773 --> 00:32:23.041
She would get mad at me if I called her nine,

00:32:23.041 --> 00:32:26.010
but I think she got it when she was nine.

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:29.080
But, that that's awesome, right?

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.282
I don't know, that's amazing. That's a way for people

00:32:31.282 --> 00:32:34.018
to express themselves in a way that they couldn't before.

00:32:34.018 --> 00:32:35.954
You did your your linguistics project.

00:32:35.954 --> 00:32:38.957
That's that's fun and interesting.

00:32:39.357 --> 00:32:43.361
But yeah, I, I also think the other the, the thing that's happening

00:32:43.361 --> 00:32:45.730
with professional software developers, when you hear from anthropic

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:48.766
or you know what I'm talking about, it's, you know,

00:32:48.766 --> 00:32:51.769
the code is going through this process and, you know,

00:32:52.603 --> 00:32:54.605
all the code still gets reviewed by people.

00:32:54.605 --> 00:32:57.976
We're not letting it get out the door if it's not at the same level as human.

00:32:58.009 --> 00:32:58.743
And it's just

00:32:58.743 --> 00:33:02.580
but what's amazing is I'm, I'm running five of these sessions at a time.

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:02.780
Right.

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:03.481
And so I've got like,

00:33:03.481 --> 00:33:07.051
software being developed in parallel in a way that is unimaginable.

00:33:07.318 --> 00:33:09.120
And, you know, the other thing is just,

00:33:10.088 --> 00:33:12.890
now the best software engineers wrote the least code.

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:14.158
Anyway,

00:33:14.158 --> 00:33:16.561
you know, the sort of classic story of, like,

00:33:16.561 --> 00:33:19.998
the difference between a junior developer and or senior developer is that a junior

00:33:19.998 --> 00:33:22.500
developer gets a problem and they sit down

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:25.136
and they put their fingers on the keyboard and they start writing code.

00:33:25.136 --> 00:33:29.073
And, senior developer gets a problem and sits there for three hours

00:33:29.073 --> 00:33:30.942
and tries to figure out what the best way to solve it is,

00:33:30.942 --> 00:33:33.411
and then spends five minutes writing code to get it done.

00:33:33.411 --> 00:33:35.246
True elegance is restraint.

00:33:35.246 --> 00:33:36.347
That's what I say.

00:33:36.347 --> 00:33:39.250
What are you seeing in the companies you're working for?

00:33:39.250 --> 00:33:42.253
Like, I find it hard to believe,

00:33:42.253 --> 00:33:45.023
and I was maybe skeptical of this, but it feels like right now

00:33:45.023 --> 00:33:46.190
we're here with technology.

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:48.092
We're like, if I were like, companies like,

00:33:48.092 --> 00:33:48.960
like I said,

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:51.996
you can build a charts of data in a way that used to be like

00:33:51.996 --> 00:33:54.332
someone would have had to get their hands dirty or etc.

00:33:54.332 --> 00:33:58.102
in the companies that you talk to is right now this having an effect

00:33:58.102 --> 00:34:00.371
on how they think about what positions they're hiring for

00:34:00.371 --> 00:34:02.473
and the skills they're looking for and so forth.

00:34:02.473 --> 00:34:04.075
I think that

00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:07.645
it's hard to answer right there.

00:34:07.645 --> 00:34:10.415
I think that certainly,

00:34:10.415 --> 00:34:14.052
I do think, I personally think if I look at the sort of layoffs

00:34:14.052 --> 00:34:15.219
in the technology industry

00:34:15.219 --> 00:34:18.423
over the last couple of years, I think some part of that is just looking

00:34:18.423 --> 00:34:21.392
at the output of these models and saying, hey,

00:34:22.193 --> 00:34:25.196
these models are able to produce it, you know, the median.

00:34:25.296 --> 00:34:26.697
And I have a whole bunch

00:34:26.697 --> 00:34:30.301
of sort of middle managers who are producing at the 65th percentile.

00:34:30.301 --> 00:34:34.839
And it's like, I can produce median for $1.50 per million tokens, or

00:34:34.839 --> 00:34:39.811
I can produce 65th percentile for however many hundreds of thousand dollars a year.

00:34:39.811 --> 00:34:42.013
It's a sort of fairly simple trade off.

00:34:42.013 --> 00:34:42.647
I think.

00:34:42.647 --> 00:34:44.882
So I do think there's a lot of downstream effects.

00:34:44.882 --> 00:34:47.385
I think the other thing that's happening is, is kind of like middle

00:34:47.385 --> 00:34:50.421
management is under threat because it's the realization that, hey,

00:34:50.421 --> 00:34:53.458
like part of what these models are amazing at is, is,

00:34:53.758 --> 00:34:55.393
I think of them as like a fuzzy interface.

00:34:55.393 --> 00:34:58.362
They can sort of turn any data into any other data, right?

00:34:58.362 --> 00:35:01.666
You can sort of transform data from one format to another.

00:35:01.799 --> 00:35:04.268
You can take a PDF and you can turn it into charts. Right.

00:35:04.268 --> 00:35:05.503
And there's whole people who exist.

00:35:05.503 --> 00:35:07.438
Or, you know, if you think about what product managers

00:35:07.438 --> 00:35:09.607
do, a lot of what product managers do is they take

00:35:09.607 --> 00:35:13.044
how people are using a product and they try to transform it into a,

00:35:13.177 --> 00:35:16.981
format that engineers can then use to figure out what to do.

00:35:16.981 --> 00:35:18.249
And I think a lot of those kind of,

00:35:20.251 --> 00:35:21.853
a lot of those pieces that

00:35:21.853 --> 00:35:25.556
used to just be kind of transferring knowledge.

00:35:26.457 --> 00:35:28.826
I've always said, Tracy,

00:35:28.826 --> 00:35:31.762
I think one of the most important roles in any organization

00:35:31.762 --> 00:35:33.264
is essentially translation work.

00:35:33.264 --> 00:35:37.001
And you see it in the newsroom where it's like, here is a team

00:35:37.001 --> 00:35:41.906
specialized in emerging market currencies, and then they have to like

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:45.276
they have to then tell the senior editors what they're working on.

00:35:45.276 --> 00:35:48.713
But the senior editors who are maybe more generalist don't really know, like,

00:35:48.713 --> 00:35:51.716
why like some sort of like, you know, one.

00:35:51.782 --> 00:35:51.916
Yeah.

00:35:51.916 --> 00:35:53.451
And Carrie is important

00:35:53.451 --> 00:35:56.754
and that a really important role within any organization is essentially the,

00:35:57.054 --> 00:36:00.024
the team that can translate between the generalist team and the specialist.

00:36:00.024 --> 00:36:00.725
Absolutely.

00:36:00.725 --> 00:36:03.661
And so I that's an interesting observation in the sort of engineering

00:36:03.661 --> 00:36:07.231
world is like, okay, these are tools that are in some sense translation tool.

00:36:07.765 --> 00:36:08.766
So we talked to

00:36:08.766 --> 00:36:12.036
I agree completely by the way, but we talked about vibe coding.

00:36:12.036 --> 00:36:16.641
And Joe has this application, that I don't think you're looking to monetize.

00:36:16.707 --> 00:36:19.110
No, I'm just trying to make it for the good of the world.

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:21.112
Right. Okay. When did that become a common,

00:36:22.647 --> 00:36:23.781
What did.

00:36:23.781 --> 00:36:28.052
But like this opens up massive questions for software as a service, right.

00:36:28.052 --> 00:36:28.653
For SAS.

00:36:28.653 --> 00:36:31.956
Because if everyone can write their own software,

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:36.561
you can replicate anything that's out there that is currently charging money.

00:36:36.561 --> 00:36:39.564
What's going to happen to software?

00:36:39.897 --> 00:36:42.033
I think software is pretty screwed.

00:36:42.033 --> 00:36:43.301
A lot of it at least.

00:36:43.301 --> 00:36:44.035
Not all of it.

00:36:44.035 --> 00:36:44.402
You know,

00:36:44.402 --> 00:36:47.939
you still, depends on whether you call that cloud provider software or not.

00:36:48.306 --> 00:36:50.007
You know, you still need to run this stuff somewhere.

00:36:50.007 --> 00:36:53.411
And I think there's, there's certain kinds of software that,

00:36:53.411 --> 00:36:56.414
you know, you just don't really want to be in the business of writing.

00:36:56.681 --> 00:37:00.017
You know, I, as someone who's tried to build a project management

00:37:00.017 --> 00:37:01.285
system, I'd really rather.

00:37:01.285 --> 00:37:03.487
I don't think anybody should be in that business.

00:37:05.056 --> 00:37:06.090
But I do think

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:09.227
fundamentally, I mean, we see this every day inside enterprises.

00:37:09.227 --> 00:37:14.298
The the sort of build versus buy pendulum has just swung.

00:37:14.298 --> 00:37:18.669
And, you know, I mean, I used to run a SAS company and we sold to enterprises

00:37:18.669 --> 00:37:23.241
and, you know, for a long time that, that I think that made a lot of sense, right?

00:37:23.241 --> 00:37:24.542
Because like, hey,

00:37:24.542 --> 00:37:27.545
it just didn't make sense to try to build this thing on your own.

00:37:27.678 --> 00:37:31.048
And so but the price of that was, you know, won the price, right?

00:37:31.082 --> 00:37:33.217
Like, and it got to be more and more expensive.

00:37:33.217 --> 00:37:36.053
The other price was that you were paying for a lot of stuff you didn't need.

00:37:36.053 --> 00:37:36.187
Right?

00:37:36.187 --> 00:37:41.259
Because the whole job of building SAS is you need to generalize problems

00:37:41.259 --> 00:37:44.462
and say you build things that are going to work for everybody,

00:37:44.695 --> 00:37:47.431
and that means either you have to sort of adapt

00:37:47.431 --> 00:37:50.468
or you have to build this sort of very configurable, software.

00:37:51.569 --> 00:37:53.004
And I think and

00:37:53.004 --> 00:37:56.007
what I see just, you know, firsthand is that,

00:37:56.707 --> 00:37:59.977
inside these organizations, you can now solve

00:38:00.478 --> 00:38:03.848
very specific problems that are highly valuable.

00:38:05.683 --> 00:38:09.954
And not only can you solve them better than generic software,

00:38:09.954 --> 00:38:12.990
but you can actually, in a lot of ways, do it for less money

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:14.859
because you're trying to tackle less stuff.

00:38:14.859 --> 00:38:16.627
You didn't need the 16

00:38:16.627 --> 00:38:19.630
other features you bought it for, the one that you really, really cared about.

00:38:20.564 --> 00:38:24.302
And so, I think that part of it, you know, I don't like there's,

00:38:24.368 --> 00:38:26.871
I definitely think there are pieces of the software industry

00:38:26.871 --> 00:38:29.040
that are going to, you know, come out the other side.

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:31.375
You're going to nobody wants to deal with payroll, right?

00:38:31.375 --> 00:38:32.777
Like, you know, somebody, you're still going to buy

00:38:32.777 --> 00:38:35.446
some payroll software and you're still going to have that.

00:38:35.446 --> 00:38:37.948
But, you know, I do think there are a lot of pieces

00:38:37.948 --> 00:38:42.653
where the software existed essentially as a kind of wrapper around a database.

00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:46.624
And now you're just going to, you know, with just the database, you can do that.

00:38:46.791 --> 00:38:50.227
And then, you know, the other piece I'd say here is it's this is not this is

00:38:50.227 --> 00:38:54.532
a kind of confluence of circumstances where it's not just the coding, it's

00:38:54.532 --> 00:38:58.703
also the fact that you have AI to do a whole bunch of work.

00:38:58.703 --> 00:39:02.340
So, you know, if we pick on CRM for a second, right, like, you know.

00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:03.174
Salesforce.com.

00:39:03.174 --> 00:39:07.445
Salesforce.com, we can, you know, you look at what the interface of that is.

00:39:07.445 --> 00:39:11.782
And essentially it has existed to get salespeople to take unstructured

00:39:11.782 --> 00:39:14.852
data, which is sales meetings, and turn it into structured data that so

00:39:14.852 --> 00:39:18.589
it can be stored in a database and now you have AI.

00:39:18.589 --> 00:39:22.593
And AI is very capable of taking unstructured data

00:39:22.993 --> 00:39:24.328
directly from the source.

00:39:24.328 --> 00:39:26.163
So you have people recording meetings

00:39:26.163 --> 00:39:29.400
and then it can structured into any data that you want.

00:39:29.433 --> 00:39:33.304
This is one of the very first sort of mind blowing moments I had was

00:39:33.304 --> 00:39:34.405
that I could give it,

00:39:35.873 --> 00:39:37.074
Json interface.

00:39:37.074 --> 00:39:40.711
I could describe exactly what I wanted the data structure to be,

00:39:40.878 --> 00:39:44.181
and it would give me back that information in that data structure.

00:39:44.348 --> 00:39:46.450
And we've just basically been having a bunch of humans

00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:48.753
do that work for a very long time, whether it's in CRM

00:39:48.753 --> 00:39:50.521
or project management or any of these other places,

00:39:50.521 --> 00:39:52.857
and the ability to just kind of get rid of that whole thing.

00:39:52.857 --> 00:39:55.493
I think it really does bring into question

00:39:55.493 --> 00:39:57.395
the value of a lot of these software companies.

00:39:57.395 --> 00:39:57.561
Well,

00:39:57.561 --> 00:40:01.298
so we have seen like a lot of software stocks, they look like melting ice cubes

00:40:01.599 --> 00:40:02.400
right now.

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:06.303
Maybe the so what I want to talk I mean this is like

00:40:06.337 --> 00:40:08.072
you know, our listeners who are investors,

00:40:08.072 --> 00:40:11.742
there's a pretty high stakes question of like what residual value there is.

00:40:11.742 --> 00:40:13.978
But talk a little bit more about Salesforce.

00:40:13.978 --> 00:40:14.779
Maybe this should be a time

00:40:14.779 --> 00:40:18.783
to learn about what it actually does as it's massively being disrupted.

00:40:18.783 --> 00:40:21.185
Now we get around to learning what Salesforce is.

00:40:21.185 --> 00:40:23.187
But I know it's like many things, there are apps

00:40:23.187 --> 00:40:26.490
that people built on to Salesforce, but this sounds like we're hitting on one.

00:40:26.490 --> 00:40:27.992
I think probably one of the crucial questions

00:40:27.992 --> 00:40:29.994
for like the future of the software industry.

00:40:29.994 --> 00:40:30.928
So talk a little bit

00:40:30.928 --> 00:40:33.964
more about like the current approach and what people are buying

00:40:33.964 --> 00:40:38.302
when they buy a package or subscribe to a service from Salesforce.

00:40:38.436 --> 00:40:42.139
And then what the unlock opportunity is from having,

00:40:42.473 --> 00:40:45.476
I like, live in the same world as all your files.

00:40:45.876 --> 00:40:46.210
Yeah.

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:49.213
So I think if you if we take CRM

00:40:49.513 --> 00:40:52.583
as a general category, say, you know, the biggest players there are.

00:40:52.616 --> 00:40:53.684
That's customer relationship.

00:40:53.684 --> 00:40:55.653
Customer relationship management, that's like where

00:40:55.653 --> 00:40:59.457
you know Salesforce does it, SAP does it, HubSpot does it for the mid-market.

00:41:01.025 --> 00:41:04.094
You know, when I think about that product and I think about the way we've used it

00:41:04.094 --> 00:41:04.829
inside enterprise

00:41:04.829 --> 00:41:08.599
sales organizations, essentially, you know, it's a database of companies.

00:41:08.599 --> 00:41:09.800
It's a database of contacts.

00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:12.069
It's a database of deals you have in the pipeline,

00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:15.806
and it's a way to track all those deals you guys hit on something before

00:41:15.806 --> 00:41:20.377
that I think is is really it, which is like inside companies.

00:41:21.278 --> 00:41:24.415
There is a huge group of people and who exists to answer

00:41:24.415 --> 00:41:27.418
the question from management of what is the status of something.

00:41:27.751 --> 00:41:28.085
Right.

00:41:28.085 --> 00:41:30.588
And you know, that can be sales management, it can be product management.

00:41:30.588 --> 00:41:32.823
It doesn't matter. Right? It could be within a newsroom.

00:41:32.823 --> 00:41:36.293
Somebody wants to know what the status is and somebody else exists

00:41:36.293 --> 00:41:38.729
to go figure out what the answer to that question is.

00:41:38.729 --> 00:41:42.099
And so fundamentally, I think those CRM tools

00:41:42.099 --> 00:41:45.936
are bought first and foremost to answer what is the status, right?

00:41:45.936 --> 00:41:47.671
What's my pipeline look like?

00:41:47.671 --> 00:41:49.006
And to answer what your pipeline looks like,

00:41:49.006 --> 00:41:52.009
you need a bunch of salespeople putting deals in.

00:41:52.276 --> 00:41:54.245
And those deals are associated with contacts and companies,

00:41:54.245 --> 00:41:55.946
and they say, when is that deal going to close?

00:41:55.946 --> 00:41:58.949
And and essentially you were asking

00:41:58.949 --> 00:42:02.753
the salespeople to make the updates in the system to do that. And

00:42:03.854 --> 00:42:06.457
just very tactically, I mean, you know,

00:42:06.457 --> 00:42:10.427
I run a company now, we talk to a lot of we have a lot of sales calls.

00:42:10.427 --> 00:42:14.398
We record those calls and they get transcribed.

00:42:14.398 --> 00:42:17.401
And the AI then looks through them and makes decisions

00:42:17.401 --> 00:42:20.804
about where this deal should be in the process.

00:42:21.171 --> 00:42:25.075
And it's much better than having somebody try to go update it,

00:42:25.075 --> 00:42:26.410
because those people never updated.

00:42:26.410 --> 00:42:29.146
Anyway, the secret of all of this enterprise software

00:42:29.146 --> 00:42:32.149
is that nobody was using it the way that anybody wanted to anyway.

00:42:32.583 --> 00:42:33.884
And so, you know,

00:42:33.884 --> 00:42:38.522
I think that that is sort of, you know, a lot of what's happening there.

00:42:38.522 --> 00:42:39.990
Again, it's sort of some of it's the coding,

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:41.559
some of it's just the core capabilities.

00:42:41.559 --> 00:42:43.627
And then, you know, you still need databases, right?

00:42:43.627 --> 00:42:45.863
So it's like, you know, you look at what Databricks and Snowflake

00:42:45.863 --> 00:42:48.866
and, you know, I think those folks are still sort of genuinely sitting

00:42:48.866 --> 00:42:52.937
in a pretty good place where, you know, all software has to sit on, sort of

00:42:53.203 --> 00:42:57.141
on top of some database that you can sort of read and write to.

00:42:58.042 --> 00:43:01.045
But, you know, I think some of those categories that were

00:43:01.512 --> 00:43:05.549
specifically focused on kind of like human input.

00:43:06.283 --> 00:43:08.552
Now, of course, you know, Salesforce has a whole AI thing

00:43:08.552 --> 00:43:10.254
and they're saying, hey, you shouldn't have humans

00:43:10.254 --> 00:43:14.191
inputting in Salesforce, you know, to at sales is just one small piece.

00:43:14.191 --> 00:43:17.795
I have a whole customer support thing, which obviously also has

00:43:17.795 --> 00:43:21.365
an interesting implication where you know, you're doing support with AI agents.

00:43:21.365 --> 00:43:23.100
And so some of it comes back to seeds.

00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:26.637
I mean, you know, it gets to be fairly complicated, but I do think

00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:31.408
I think the fundamental underlying thing is anybody who buys software

00:43:31.909 --> 00:43:36.647
that is, you know, SAS, you're always buying for a subset

00:43:36.647 --> 00:43:41.085
of the functionality that there's nobody is using 100% of the functionality of SAS.

00:43:41.352 --> 00:43:43.954
And so there's always a trade off that's happening there where, you know,

00:43:43.954 --> 00:43:45.956
you're spending more money than you need to

00:43:45.956 --> 00:43:48.192
because you're not using all of these pieces.

00:43:48.192 --> 00:43:50.961
And so, you know, if you can more narrowly focus that,

00:43:50.961 --> 00:43:54.431
that is where you could say, hey, we could solve this kind of more narrow problem.

00:43:54.431 --> 00:43:56.000
And not only can we solve it more narrowly,

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.901
we can solve it way more effectively.

00:43:57.901 --> 00:44:02.239
Because, you know, the trick with AI is that the more specific

00:44:02.239 --> 00:44:04.508
you are with it, the better the output is, right?

00:44:04.508 --> 00:44:05.476
So it's like if you know,

00:44:05.476 --> 00:44:08.979
if outside of coding, if you just asked ChatGPT to write you

00:44:08.979 --> 00:44:12.383
a story, it's going to write you a very, very median story.

00:44:12.383 --> 00:44:14.818
Right? Sort of exactly the median.

00:44:14.818 --> 00:44:19.356
But if you work with it and you, you know, then you're going to get it.

00:44:19.423 --> 00:44:22.359
The more of your own expertise you imbuing it,

00:44:22.359 --> 00:44:25.329
the further up above the median it's going to be.

00:44:25.329 --> 00:44:28.332
And it's going to be, you know, of course, that also means it's less

00:44:28.832 --> 00:44:31.135
where the line is between what's AI and what's not.

00:44:31.135 --> 00:44:34.138
AI is going to continue to get blurrier.

00:44:34.138 --> 00:44:37.141
Joe, how much does cloud code actually cost?

00:44:37.241 --> 00:44:38.108
Do you know?

00:44:38.108 --> 00:44:40.644
Well, I paid for the,

00:44:40.644 --> 00:44:44.848
200 or $200 a month version, but, like high roller.

00:44:44.848 --> 00:44:47.651
Yeah. No, but, you know, I think it's.

00:44:47.651 --> 00:44:49.420
You could get it with the pro version of like,

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:51.655
or whatever the, the version of that below $20.

00:44:51.655 --> 00:44:54.658
But I hit a limit fairly quickly and I was like, I didn't have my website up.

00:44:54.658 --> 00:44:56.493
So like and then I bought the fact.

00:44:56.493 --> 00:45:01.198
Then I paid $5 for the extra compute and I was like, this is dumb.

00:45:01.198 --> 00:45:02.433
I think I'll just.

00:45:02.433 --> 00:45:03.667
Yeah. Oh, okay.

00:45:03.667 --> 00:45:06.670
So we going out to two nice dinners, right?

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:08.238
That's not you know, when I think about that way,

00:45:08.238 --> 00:45:10.607
it doesn't seem that big of a deal. It's worth it to you. Yeah. Okay.

00:45:10.607 --> 00:45:12.076
So I think we can all agree

00:45:12.076 --> 00:45:16.013
this is like a valuable service that cloud code is providing.

00:45:16.413 --> 00:45:18.849
But we touched on this in the intro.

00:45:18.849 --> 00:45:23.153
It seems like the models just keep replicating themselves really,

00:45:23.153 --> 00:45:23.721
really quickly.

00:45:23.721 --> 00:45:27.491
So anything that cloud code can do, I would expect another model

00:45:27.491 --> 00:45:31.328
will come in in like a month, maybe less, and do the exact same thing.

00:45:31.829 --> 00:45:36.500
What does that mean for the actual like valuations of these companies

00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:40.571
and the models like how are they going to monetize it when it seems so difficult

00:45:40.938 --> 00:45:43.741
to actually differentiate yourself, especially

00:45:43.741 --> 00:45:46.744
for like a substantial portion of time?

00:45:46.744 --> 00:45:47.244
Yeah.

00:45:47.244 --> 00:45:48.579
Well, so again here,

00:45:48.579 --> 00:45:53.083
I think we have to distinguish between cloud code and the cloud model.

00:45:53.083 --> 00:45:56.754
So in Cloud Code's case, if you're using, you know the latest

00:45:56.754 --> 00:45:59.790
version, you're using opus 4.5 which is the model.

00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:02.025
Opus 4.5 has a price of,

00:46:02.025 --> 00:46:05.996
you know, something in the dollar, 50 to $2 for a million input tokens

00:46:05.996 --> 00:46:07.498
and whatever it is on the output,

00:46:07.498 --> 00:46:10.167
which is like roughly the going rate for cutting edge models.

00:46:10.167 --> 00:46:12.603
Gemini three Pro is the same price.

00:46:14.304 --> 00:46:17.174
OpenAI, ChatGPT 5.2 is there.

00:46:17.174 --> 00:46:18.108
They're all the same price.

00:46:18.108 --> 00:46:21.111
So the first thing is, is you have to differentiate between those.

00:46:21.712 --> 00:46:24.782
And so I think a big part of what anthropic is trying to do

00:46:24.782 --> 00:46:26.650
is they're trying to lock people into cloud code.

00:46:26.650 --> 00:46:30.120
In fact, there's just some, controversy amongst

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:35.292
some nerds, where, open code, which is a competitor to cloud Code,

00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:39.563
used to let you use your cloud Max $200.

00:46:39.563 --> 00:46:43.367
So the trick with the cloud Max plan is if you're just buying those,

00:46:43.367 --> 00:46:46.970
that number of tokens, it would cost you significantly more than $200.

00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:49.439
It is a super, super discounted plan.

00:46:49.439 --> 00:46:53.443
You are probably you have the access I have the access to use,

00:46:53.877 --> 00:46:57.381
I would guess in the thousand or $2,000 of tokens,

00:46:58.615 --> 00:47:00.017
for my $200 a month.

00:47:00.017 --> 00:47:03.520
So it's it's a very, very heavily subsidized plan and open code,

00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:06.957
which is an open source version of cloud code, a sort of competitor.

00:47:07.858 --> 00:47:11.361
They had found a way that they would let you use your cloud

00:47:11.361 --> 00:47:15.232
Max plan with open code and anthropic last week.

00:47:15.899 --> 00:47:17.434
Shut that down. Yeah.

00:47:17.434 --> 00:47:20.337
And some open code, people got very upset, because they

00:47:20.337 --> 00:47:23.407
said, like, this is not what you're supposed to do, or.

00:47:23.407 --> 00:47:25.475
I mean, I'm not sure exactly what they said.

00:47:25.475 --> 00:47:28.478
I never felt like I got a particularly good argument out of it.

00:47:29.213 --> 00:47:31.682
But, you know, I do think part of what they're

00:47:31.682 --> 00:47:34.651
trying to get at, because is

00:47:34.818 --> 00:47:37.087
that, you know, at the very top models

00:47:37.087 --> 00:47:40.290
like these are all amazing, like the Google,

00:47:41.258 --> 00:47:43.227
OpenAI and anthropic,

00:47:43.227 --> 00:47:46.463
their best models are all on par with each other.

00:47:46.463 --> 00:47:48.866
I mean, I would move them around a little bit.

00:47:48.866 --> 00:47:51.869
I still think opus 4.5 is the best model out there.

00:47:51.869 --> 00:47:54.605
But you know, I mean that might change tomorrow.

00:47:54.605 --> 00:47:57.841
Like, and that's where something like Cloud Code is really interesting

00:47:57.841 --> 00:48:01.044
because it's a, a product that is very it's just theirs.

00:48:01.044 --> 00:48:02.279
It's not it's a piece of software.

00:48:02.279 --> 00:48:04.381
It's not an AI model.

00:48:04.381 --> 00:48:07.751
And so it's sort of it's less able to be disrupted.

00:48:07.784 --> 00:48:11.288
Now, again, I think if somebody else wanted to copy that.

00:48:11.288 --> 00:48:13.223
Exactly, they could.

00:48:13.223 --> 00:48:15.826
Codex has one, Gemini has one.

00:48:15.826 --> 00:48:19.029
I just think they take a very different tact with it where it's much less.

00:48:19.029 --> 00:48:19.630
And so,

00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:20.731
you know, I think what they're trying to do

00:48:20.731 --> 00:48:21.798
is get developers like me

00:48:21.798 --> 00:48:25.736
to feel very comfortable inside that, so that when we go open, I still open

00:48:25.736 --> 00:48:29.172
Codex or try Gemini or I was playing with open Code the other day and,

00:48:30.507 --> 00:48:32.976
it just doesn't feel familiar in the same way that, you know, if you're

00:48:32.976 --> 00:48:36.179
trying to move somebody from a PC to a mac, it doesn't feel familiar, right?

00:48:36.179 --> 00:48:37.948
They want to own like the ecosystem, the.

00:48:37.948 --> 00:48:39.316
Environment. The environment.

00:48:39.316 --> 00:48:41.251
Work on One world.

00:48:41.251 --> 00:48:43.687
Noah, thank you so much for coming on Atlas.

00:48:43.687 --> 00:48:46.323
I was like dying to do an episode about this topic.

00:48:46.323 --> 00:48:49.760
By the way, I don't have I psychosis, I have a cloud complex.

00:48:50.093 --> 00:48:52.396
Why is everyone making that joke? Wait.

00:48:52.396 --> 00:48:55.132
Which joke? The psychosis joke.

00:48:55.132 --> 00:48:58.468
I thought you're going to be proud of me for saying cloud complex. Oh.

00:48:58.535 --> 00:48:59.636
Oh, that is very good.

00:48:59.636 --> 00:49:02.239
I it's like I do one pun finally for Tracy.

00:49:02.239 --> 00:49:03.774
No, it's like, well, I was over making that joke.

00:49:03.774 --> 00:49:06.276
Well, I was thinking that was a joke. I was handed a shirt.

00:49:06.276 --> 00:49:08.512
I finally make a pun and you just jump right over it.

00:49:08.512 --> 00:49:09.446
Well, everyone keeps saying

00:49:09.446 --> 00:49:13.016
that cloud code is AI psychosis for smart people, right?

00:49:13.016 --> 00:49:15.018
Like, how did that become a thing?

00:49:15.018 --> 00:49:16.119
Yeah. All right.

00:49:16.119 --> 00:49:18.922
But there's a good. Fun also very bro coded I find.

00:49:18.922 --> 00:49:21.658
You think so all of. AI is bro coded.

00:49:21.658 --> 00:49:22.859
This is true.

00:49:22.859 --> 00:49:23.860
We should talk more about this.

00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:25.162
You know, we should have David Shaw on.

00:49:25.162 --> 00:49:26.363
He's been doing a lot of polling

00:49:26.363 --> 00:49:29.266
about various demographics and how they feel about AI.

00:49:29.266 --> 00:49:31.034
We should, And, yeah, some interesting I.

00:49:31.034 --> 00:49:31.535
See into that.

00:49:31.535 --> 00:49:32.803
Yeah, we should, do that.

00:49:32.803 --> 00:49:35.038
Anyway, Noah, thank you so much for coming on out, love.

00:49:35.038 --> 00:49:35.973
Thanks for having me.

00:49:35.973 --> 00:49:38.308
Well, that was fun. Tracy. I really like I.

00:49:38.308 --> 00:49:39.242
It's obvious

00:49:39.242 --> 00:49:43.013
to anyone who's been within five minutes, five feet of me for the last two weeks.

00:49:43.013 --> 00:49:45.615
I'm like, totally addicted and gone down.

00:49:45.615 --> 00:49:47.985
I never gone down the rabbit hole and stuff.

00:49:47.985 --> 00:49:52.322
But like, I for the first time unironically, I'm like, okay,

00:49:52.622 --> 00:49:56.126
this is transformative technology beyond being very impressive.

00:49:56.126 --> 00:49:57.060
Technology, right?

00:49:57.060 --> 00:50:01.231
So I've been coming to a conclusion, which is that, you know,

00:50:01.832 --> 00:50:07.571
I can be both under hyped, and overvalued simultaneously.

00:50:07.571 --> 00:50:10.974
Like, I feel like that's kind of where we are at the moment, where.

00:50:10.974 --> 00:50:12.142
You're making your stock call.

00:50:12.142 --> 00:50:15.145
Yeah. No, but seriously like it.

00:50:15.746 --> 00:50:16.780
It's a big deal.

00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:18.582
It's going to change the way we work.

00:50:18.582 --> 00:50:20.884
But is it monetizable?

00:50:20.884 --> 00:50:22.919
Can you differentiate the actual models?

00:50:22.919 --> 00:50:26.189
The better the technology gets, like, the easier

00:50:26.189 --> 00:50:28.358
it is to just do what everyone else is doing.

00:50:28.358 --> 00:50:31.194
And also like the compute gets cheaper and cheaper.

00:50:31.194 --> 00:50:33.697
So I just don't know how you monetize this. Well.

00:50:33.697 --> 00:50:35.132
So that's very interesting.

00:50:35.132 --> 00:50:39.236
His point, which is that it's the tokens are heavily subsidized still.

00:50:39.236 --> 00:50:39.603
Yeah.

00:50:39.603 --> 00:50:43.407
And so that if you're paying and actually using that $200 max program

00:50:43.407 --> 00:50:48.612
and you actually use it to the limit, Claude is going to lose money on this.

00:50:48.678 --> 00:50:50.680
Right? And then the prices keep dropping.

00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:53.617
And I know, like Claude code is okay.

00:50:53.617 --> 00:50:57.020
They're attempting to create something that resembles a traditional software

00:50:57.020 --> 00:51:00.023
ecosystem that you feel as a user that you're locked into.

00:51:00.090 --> 00:51:05.562
But so far in my various like since November 2022,

00:51:05.562 --> 00:51:07.130
when I started playing with AI,

00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:10.500
it hasn't felt like anyone has established lock in with anything.

00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:11.701
And it's very,

00:51:13.203 --> 00:51:14.638
it's very movable.

00:51:14.638 --> 00:51:17.641
And I suspect even though I have this file now on my desktop

00:51:17.641 --> 00:51:21.812
that has a file called Claude mode that gives instructions, etc.,

00:51:22.179 --> 00:51:25.482
I'm certain that if I open this file with Codex or Googles,

00:51:25.782 --> 00:51:27.784
I could probably just pick it up the same. Yeah.

00:51:27.784 --> 00:51:31.288
I also think there's a fundamental issue with the lock in strategy,

00:51:31.288 --> 00:51:34.357
because when you're talking about technology in the internet, like

00:51:34.791 --> 00:51:39.896
it just feels very against the grain to try to lock people into anything.

00:51:39.896 --> 00:51:42.933
And we've seen various projects over the years

00:51:42.933 --> 00:51:45.902
and it's it's a lot harder than it looks.

00:51:46.203 --> 00:51:46.570
Yeah.

00:51:46.570 --> 00:51:49.206
I mean, I guess I would say it's a lot harder than it looks.

00:51:49.206 --> 00:51:52.442
But then we also know the flip side, which is that tons of people are locked

00:51:52.442 --> 00:51:54.644
into software that they hate. Right? Yeah. People are.

00:51:54.644 --> 00:51:55.512
Oh, I hate people.

00:51:55.512 --> 00:51:58.315
How many times have you or I hate outlook, right?

00:51:58.315 --> 00:52:02.752
Or I hate Microsoft Teams and I hate this and I spend money on it every month

00:52:02.752 --> 00:52:05.856
and my organization can't move off of it or we can't migrate off of it.

00:52:06.022 --> 00:52:07.824
So I do think that cuts both ways.

00:52:07.824 --> 00:52:12.929
I do think he offered the best explanation I've heard of why

00:52:13.163 --> 00:52:18.301
the AI coding models are a threat to a lot of pretty big software businesses,

00:52:18.401 --> 00:52:22.105
especially, especially the point about how the user never uses

00:52:22.105 --> 00:52:25.842
all of the features that they actually that the software got built for.

00:52:26.009 --> 00:52:30.847
And therefore maybe the build versus buy calculation really starts to shift

00:52:31.014 --> 00:52:34.017
when they can just design that one feature very quickly.

00:52:34.050 --> 00:52:34.885
I totally agree.

00:52:34.885 --> 00:52:37.921
On the software side, it seems like an existential threat, but

00:52:37.921 --> 00:52:42.526
just like the locked in ecosystem of a particular model.

00:52:43.026 --> 00:52:47.130
I know he said it's not actually a model, but that seems like a bigger issue to me.

00:52:47.397 --> 00:52:48.732
I don't know, I guess we'll see.

00:52:48.732 --> 00:52:51.601
We're going to see and I don't know, I kind of think we're gonna see quickly.

00:52:51.601 --> 00:52:52.269
Yeah.

00:52:52.269 --> 00:52:55.672
That's again, that's the only certainty is like, stuff is happening.

00:52:55.672 --> 00:52:56.973
Stuff is. Happening now. Yeah.

00:52:56.973 --> 00:52:59.075
All right. Shall we leave it there? Let's leave it there.

00:52:59.075 --> 00:52:59.342
Okay.
