1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
So level 1. Alright, google.com. Here's the

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:06,160
logo. Here's the search bar. Oh, and here's

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,700
the buttons. Why are you still waiting? Well,

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,600
it's because you were missing this. This little

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,200
line of text at the bottom. See, when

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,720
Google launched, it was incredibly minimalistic compared to

7
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,920
all the other search engines out there. But

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,620
because of this, they had a problem. When

9
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:22,460
they started making user tests in the early

10
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,500
2000s with Stanford students, the students would sit

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,680
there for 45 seconds staring at the page

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,160
waiting for it to finish loading,

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,840
even though it was fully loading. And that's

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,360
because all the information. And that's because all

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,920
the information was at the top. So how

16
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,540
did they fix it? Well, with this. A

17
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,600
copyright notice that has no legal need to

18
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,620
be there, but it was put there only

19
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,260
to let you know that the page has

20
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,180
finished loading. See, this is only level 1

21
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,520
of the 7 levels of the insane rabbit

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,040
hole that is designing and building tech products.

23
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,240
And these levels are what makes the difference

24
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,600
between products that feel really bad, that you

25
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,020
hate using, and products that end up generating

26
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,080
billions of billions of dollars in revenue, and

27
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,640
that end up changing the world. We're going

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,800
to go from uncovering the smallest details to

29
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,800
the entire product strategies of some of the

30
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,840
biggest tech companies in the world. But even

31
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,880
here at level 1, there's so much more

32
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,020
that you don't see behind the tech that

33
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,760
you use every day. Take a look at

34
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,000
this. This is a nice rounded interface. So

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,460
here for these checkboxes, we're going to match

36
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:22,240
the style, we're going to make them round.

37
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,500
But now you see that there's a problem.

38
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,420
The app feels broken. And that's because by

39
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,380
making these round,

40
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:31,000
we made them look like something else that

41
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,160
we're used to. Radio buttons, where you can

42
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,520
only select one option at a time. This

43
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,720
super small difference in how rounded these boxes

44
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,500
are completely changed how we interpret what we

45
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,940
see and what we think we can do

46
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,680
in this screen. And that's because we have

47
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,860
this knowledge in our brain that got reinforced

48
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,380
over thousands of times using technology that this

49
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,600
means only one option and this means that

50
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,060
you can have many. Or take a look

51
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,000
at this. Well, of course, this is a

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,260
link

53
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,500
to something. Duh. Well, no. Turns out it

54
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,020
was just some blue underlined text. And the

55
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,340
reason this fell off is that we were

56
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,980
missing this. The mouse cursor changing from the

57
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:12,140
regular arrow to the little hand that says,

58
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,180
hey, there's an action here. This might seem

59
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,820
like a small detail, but without this, our

60
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,460
interfaces would be completely unusable. Like, for example,

61
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,440
trying to drag some panel without the cursor

62
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,240
becoming their size one. Without this small visual

63
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,640
detail on your cursor, you simply wouldn't be

64
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,180
able to use any desktop computer,

65
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:30,340
and that's why this has been around from

66
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,780
the beginning since 1987, when it was invented

67
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:35,460
by Bill Atkinson for the Macintosh app HyperCard.

68
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,640
And it's stuck around to this day. Oh,

69
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,520
and all these interactions that you're seeing, I

70
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,000
build them as full working prototypes using Magic

71
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,980
Patterns, the sponsor of this video. More about

72
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,560
it later. But take a look at these.

73
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,040
These are files on your computer, but the

74
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,900
file names are really long. Now, usually when

75
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,900
you have a really, really long string on

76
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,280
an app, this happens. It gets cut and

77
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,400
these dots, which are called ellipses, appear to

78
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,040
tell you that, hey,

79
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,600
there's more. But now, with this, we cannot

80
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,840
see which one is the file version, for

81
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,360
example. Say, v1 or v2, which usually is

82
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,180
stuff that's at the end of the file

83
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,720
name. We cannot put the ellipses at the

84
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,240
beginning either, because otherwise we lose the file

85
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:11,920
name more together.

86
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:14,120
So, for example, here in macOS, when we

87
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,660
try to reduce the size of the window,

88
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,920
the file names get the ellipses in the

89
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,760
center, and letters get progressively cheaped away on

90
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,940
each side of the ellipses centered in the

91
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,260
word. So you can see the start of

92
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,700
the file name and the end of the

93
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,120
file name.

94
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,420
So this means that someone had to manually

95
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,920
go in and write all the code that

96
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,660
calculates how many letters to chip away at

97
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:33,420
each side of the ellipses just to make

98
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,440
sure this happens.

99
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,360
By the way, that someone is Scott Jensen,

100
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,800
who built this, again, for Apple in the

101
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,200
80s.

102
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,400
See, designing tech is not just about making

103
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,520
things look nice. These seemingly small visual details

104
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,160
won't get noticed by 99% of people,

105
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,960
but it's what makes our tech usable.

106
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,080
But yeah, sometimes they are there just because

107
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:53,500
they're fun. Like, for example, you drag the

108
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,620
Google Street View yellow guy, and you can

109
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,500
see that he's actually holding on to the

110
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,860
cursor and reacting to gravity as you move

111
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,240
him around.

112
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,220
Why? Well, why not?

113
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,000
And now let's start to go up a

114
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,440
level, because that's when things start to get

115
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:06,780
interesting.

116
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,360
So say you're on a call with your

117
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,440
bank. They're telling you there is a suspicious

118
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,300
activity on your account, and they need to

119
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,420
verify some information.

120
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,360
So you open your banking app to check,

121
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,300
and you see, this, Revolut, is not calling

122
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:18,500
you.

123
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,640
The people that built this app made it

124
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,400
so that it's detecting when you're on a

125
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,060
phone call and when you're opening the app

126
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:24,740
at the same time.

127
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,620
And because one of the most common scams

128
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,360
is someone pretending to be your bank and

129
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,900
asking you to do something in the app

130
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,420
while they're on the phone with you,

131
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,340
Do not read it! Do not read in

132
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:34,780
the card!

133
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,780
Revolut just tells you. Whoever's on the phone,

134
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:38,940
well, it's not us.

135
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,180
And this is what Level 2 is all

136
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,260
about. It's not just how things look.

137
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,700
It's the interactions and how they behave.

138
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:48,200
And more importantly, it's about building behaviors that

139
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,180
feel human.

140
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,480
Like take Google Maps. Your phone has a

141
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,940
touchscreen, and it's perfect for moving around this

142
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,180
map.

143
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,700
You can just drag your finger around.

144
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,200
But zooming in still requires you to pinch

145
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,080
the screen, so it requires two hands.

146
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,460
We're usually trying to navigate around. We're on

147
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:02,840
a bike.

148
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,340
It's the worst possible time to require us

149
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,060
to pinch stuff.

150
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,740
So you end up doing this weird contortionism

151
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,720
just to zoom in.

152
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,280
But actually, in Google Maps, you can double

153
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:13,820
tap and hold and drag your finger up

154
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,660
and down to zoom in and out with

155
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,240
one finger.

156
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,220
You can actually do it in almost all

157
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,240
the applications where you can pinch to zoom.

158
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,620
The first time I learned about this, I

159
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,220
was like, I'm sorry, what?

160
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,280
But the problem with this is that while

161
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,600
it definitely goes into the genius category, there

162
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,380
is no way to know that you can

163
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,200
actually do this.

164
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,320
Most people don't even know, but one interaction

165
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,800
that instead gets used billions of times every

166
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,060
single day is this.

167
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,740
You know, when you drag down the top

168
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,720
of a list to refresh.

169
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:42,040
This interaction is incredibly intuitive, and it removes

170
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,080
the need for an additional refresh button.

171
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,240
But while this looks totally innocuous, today this

172
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,020
feature is used by the biggest social media

173
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:49,920
companies on the planet,

174
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,760
paired with infinite scrolling feeds, like Instagram, to

175
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,040
show you something new every time you refresh.

176
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,460
And this one simple interaction is probably responsible

177
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,160
for billions of dollars of revenue in ads

178
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,940
on these feeds.

179
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,640
But now, let's go up a level once

180
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,860
again, because in 2008, music streaming had a

181
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:07,140
problem.

182
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,440
Piracy was everywhere.

183
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,900
People were illegally downloading songs all over the

184
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,140
place.

185
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,000
And if I wanted to purchase my entire

186
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,240
current Spotify library legally on iTunes back then,

187
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,220
it would have run me $3,800.

188
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,060
And I would have to synchronize all these

189
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,060
songs manually on all of my devices.

190
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:23,960
And that's when Spotify came in.

191
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,120
But they had a problem.

192
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,820
See, they started with this promise of instant

193
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,780
music streaming.

194
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,260
Just choose a track and immediately listen to

195
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:31,400
it.

196
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,400
But the problem is that internet speeds back

197
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:36,980
then, especially mobile, weren't anywhere near as fast

198
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,640
as they are today.

199
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,220
They tried what anyone would.

200
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,280
Just host the songs on their servers, and

201
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,640
anytime someone needs a song, just stream it

202
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,480
down to the device.

203
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,120
And it was atrocious.

204
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,240
It could take from 30 seconds to a

205
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,560
full minute for a song to start playing.

206
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,880
So that's when they had an idea.

207
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,000
They bought a company that actually powered piracy.

208
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,540
And that you might remember called uTorrent.

209
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,380
And sold uTorrent almost immediately.

210
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,140
But the reason they did this is to

211
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,020
get this one guy.

212
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,420
Ludwig Strigus.

213
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,920
And he rebuilt Spotify's infrastructure at the time

214
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,540
using the same technology that powered piracy.

215
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,220
Peer to peer.

216
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,600
See, when you play the song, it came

217
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,880
from three places at once.

218
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,700
Spotify servers, your own cash, and other Spotify

219
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,600
users near you.

220
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,160
A 2010 study found that only 8.8

221
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,520
% of the music came from Spotify servers.

222
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,040
36% came from other users, and the

223
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,620
rest was smartly downloaded already on your device.

224
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,880
They took the exact technology that the music

225
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,420
industry were suing people over, and used it

226
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,940
to build a legal alternative.

227
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,940
And as a user, you never noticed.

228
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,540
You just clicked on a song, and it

229
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:38,780
worked.

230
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:40,460
See, most people think that great products are

231
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,120
built around great technology.

232
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,480
But most of the times, it's the opposite

233
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,180
that happens.

234
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,740
You have a great idea for how the

235
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,220
perfect interaction and experience looks like, and then

236
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,480
you find the technology that makes it possible.

237
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,780
Because the ones that really matter are those

238
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,040
that make incredible experiences possible.

239
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:59,240
But also where the technology disappears, and you

240
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,340
never see it.

241
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,060
But as we get to level 4, this

242
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,200
is where we start to get into the

243
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,660
really powerful laws that control how tech products

244
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,920
are designed and built.

245
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,820
And how they can also be used to

246
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:09,520
manipulate you.

247
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,220
So you just finished an episode on Netflix.

248
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,520
The usual cliffhanger, credits roll, and three, two,

249
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,220
what?

250
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,660
The next episode already started.

251
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,780
See, this was an example of level 4

252
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,520
product design.

253
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,660
And it's something that seems small, but it's

254
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,300
incredibly powerful to control the behavior of millions

255
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:24,940
of users.

256
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,320
Both in a good and in a bad

257
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:27,580
way.

258
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:28,760
Defaults.

259
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,820
Oh look, I got ghosted by a 10

260
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,380
out of 10 on both iMessage and WhatsApp.

261
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,200
Now, other than the fact that I need

262
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,840
more res, there's something else going on here.

263
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:39,680
On WhatsApp, read receipts are on by default.

264
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,820
But on iMessage, you instead choose if you

265
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,440
want them or not.

266
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,180
Which for the most part would mean that

267
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,280
people turn them off.

268
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,720
Since when presented with the choice, users tend

269
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,360
to choose the option that gives out less

270
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,040
information about them on average.

271
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,880
Now, this might seem like a small difference.

272
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,700
But since most people never change their settings,

273
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,620
this creates completely different social dynamics.

274
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,580
On WhatsApp, seen without a reply is bloated.

275
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,000
You saw my message.

276
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,360
Why didn't you respond?

277
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,100
On iMessage, nobody knows if you read it.

278
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,260
Same feature, different default, different relationship.

279
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,160
This is called default bias.

280
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,360
And it's not just in your tech.

281
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,180
This is a chart of the percentage of

282
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,480
organ donors in different European countries.

283
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,660
Try to guess what is the difference between

284
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,380
the first and the second group.

285
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,860
Well, the only difference is the default choice.

286
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,940
In Austria, the default is to donate.

287
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,820
And you opt out of donating.

288
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,760
Well, in Denmark, you need to opt in

289
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:33,440
to donate.

290
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,200
And this is, well, default bias.

291
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,700
But here is where defaults become worth billions

292
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,400
of dollars.

293
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,500
Have you ever wondered why did Google buy

294
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:41,920
Android?

295
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,840
Spent billions to make it a worldwide mobile

296
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,000
operating system only to give it away for

297
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,360
free?

298
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,220
Or why did they build Chrome?

299
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,900
Well, not because they love making browsers or

300
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,740
operating systems,

301
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,200
but because whoever controls the platform can set

302
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,100
the defaults,

303
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,260
including the search engine which they set to

304
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,020
Google, where they make their money.

305
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,960
And for the devices they don't control, Google

306
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,360
pays Apple $20 billion a year

307
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,360
just to be the default option on Safari.

308
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,140
They estimated that they would lose 60%

309
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,100
to 80% of iPhone search traffic if

310
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:11,860
they didn't do this.

311
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,300
Not because people would switch to Bing, but

312
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,880
because people just use whatever is already there.

313
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,860
Now, see all these examples and visuals that

314
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,300
I've shown you in this very video.

315
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,780
Well, these are real working components made with

316
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,120
the sponsor of this video, Magic Patterns,

317
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:29,400
because it's built exactly for this.

318
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,020
See, Magic Patterns is not about building entire

319
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,000
apps from scratch,

320
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,460
but it's about allowing builders like me to

321
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,860
quickly try different designs,

322
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,260
iterations and components with natural language just by

323
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:40,600
chatting.

324
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,660
If you notice, all the examples I made

325
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,440
in this video were also in the same

326
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,180
visual style.

327
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,200
And that's because with Magic Patterns, you can

328
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,160
set your product's styling, colors and visuals,

329
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,340
and have it follow it when prototyping.

330
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,540
You can even upload screenshots as a reference

331
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,160
to guide the AI towards what you're envisioning.

332
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,020
Once you're happy with something, you can export

333
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:58,760
it straight to Figma,

334
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,980
sync it to GitHub, or deploy it to

335
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,680
a custom domain.

336
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,260
If you're working with a team, there's a

337
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,220
shared canvas for real-time collaboration.

338
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,360
You can join the army of designers, engineers,

339
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,720
thinkers, and product teams,

340
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,920
or the using Magic Patterns with the link

341
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,740
in the description,

342
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,520
which also gives the viewers of my channel

343
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,860
a nice little discount.

344
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,480
But now, let's go back to the video,

345
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,480
because now that we get to level 5,

346
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,000
we start to blur the boundaries between product

347
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,320
design and product strategy.

348
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,760
And this is where you start to see

349
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,560
the more important product decisions that shape how

350
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,560
we use something.

351
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,340
So, let me show you how I personally

352
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:32,000
used level 5 to build this.

353
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,400
This is Flask.

354
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,740
It's my own company and my own product.

355
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,440
It's a video collaboration tool where you can

356
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,320
collaborate on videos,

357
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,000
record comments, and share your screen.

358
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,740
And all of the comments appear visually right

359
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,540
on the video's timeline.

360
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,240
Now, for every comment, we need to give

361
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,640
out key information that we cannot miss.

362
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:49,060
For example, who created the comment, Enrico in

363
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:49,400
this case,

364
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,760
when this was added, or which timestamp it's

365
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,740
referencing in the video.

366
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,180
You also need a way to mark the

367
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:54,900
comment as done.

368
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,620
Now, the most basic approach that any designer

369
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,120
would take is this.

370
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,900
Find a nice way to get them out,

371
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,860
and you're done.

372
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,100
For example, this is what my main competitor

373
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:04,480
does.

374
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,000
You have all the info right here, and

375
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,460
you can mark a comment as done right

376
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:07,720
there.

377
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,540
But instead, what if we take a level

378
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,480
5 strategic approach to this,

379
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,380
where we don't just think about how to

380
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,560
arrange things visually,

381
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,940
but how to architect the logic of the

382
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,440
entire app to make this all much more

383
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:19,940
elegant.

384
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,240
For example, instead of deciding that this is

385
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,180
a done toggle,

386
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:25,380
why don't we create the general purpose tagging

387
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:25,720
system,

388
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,060
where each element can have custom tags.

389
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,300
And then we'll create a default one called

390
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:30,760
done,

391
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,020
and another one called important.

392
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,540
So we can show users that you can

393
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,300
actually have more than one at a time.

394
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,080
And now, these are not fixed in place.

395
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,680
If you don't like done, and you want

396
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,600
to use it for something else,

397
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,920
you can just delete it.

398
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,720
But as people started to request more and

399
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,320
more features,

400
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,100
they wanted to be able to filter by

401
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:45,460
user,

402
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,860
or by custom tag, or by creation date,

403
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,820
and it was getting so complicated.

404
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,260
So instead, we're going to make one structural

405
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,320
design change,

406
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,640
and say that everything is a tag.

407
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,660
So now the creator becomes a tag.

408
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,280
The creation time becomes a tag.

409
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,740
Even the link timestamp becomes a tag.

410
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,980
Now, these are not editable by the user,

411
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,360
but watch what happens.

412
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,140
Now I can create a filtering system

413
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,620
that filters by multiple types of tags in

414
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,320
the same place,

415
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,240
and it all feels logical.

416
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,920
Now I don't need to have a dedicated

417
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,680
row up top with its own layout.

418
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,740
I can just have a list of tags.

419
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,080
And now, a while later,

420
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,540
I had to build a system to notify

421
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,740
users of new comments that got added

422
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,120
since they last visited.

423
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,020
Normally, I would have to create an entirely

424
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:26,600
new view

425
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,880
to show these comments.

426
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,240
But now that we made this structural design

427
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:30,680
decision

428
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,420
that everything is a tag,

429
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,680
you can see that I just need to

430
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,000
add a tag called new to the comments.

431
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,280
And clicking here will just trigger a filter

432
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,420
for that tag,

433
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,760
which uses all the existing stuff that we

434
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,620
already built before.

435
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,900
Having a great structural design in the logic

436
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,000
of how your app works

437
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,440
makes everything else simpler.

438
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,180
That's why in a similar way to Flask,

439
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,560
Notion took the decision to make everything a

440
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:52,820
page.

441
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,700
Even though it might be displayed as a

442
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,080
calendar or a feed or a table,

443
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,260
everything is a page.

444
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,600
Or while Slack decided that everything is a

445
00:13:59,600 --> 00:13:59,880
channel.

446
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,440
These are all examples of level 5.

447
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,660
But at level 6 is where we start

448
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,860
to leave product design

449
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,540
as you think about it and start to

450
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,660
enter the realm of product strategy.

451
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,000
See, for example, video has been around forever.

452
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,600
You can record yourself on your phone.

453
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,880
You can have a video call on Zoom.

454
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:15,860
You can upload to YouTube.

455
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,060
Video is soft.

456
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,660
We don't need any more video products.

457
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,120
But then Loom came along and said,

458
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,980
what if video wasn't for entertainment or for

459
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,560
live calls,

460
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,480
but for replacing meetings?

461
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,340
What if instead of scheduling 30 minutes with

462
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:28,740
your team,

463
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,980
you just record a 3-minute video and

464
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:31,540
send it out?

465
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,380
They didn't invent video.

466
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,540
They didn't invent recording.

467
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,680
They didn't invent players.

468
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,980
They reframed what video is for.

469
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,620
And this little reframe built a company that

470
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,600
Atlassian bought for $975 million.

471
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,660
Or take Superhuman.

472
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,440
Email has been around for decades.

473
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,500
Gmail is free.

474
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,760
What could you possibly do here?

475
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,300
Well, Superhuman reframed email from inbox you need

476
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:54,760
to manage

477
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,780
to the fastest email out there.

478
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,820
They added keyboard shortcuts for everything.

479
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,540
They show you how long it takes to

480
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,760
get through your inbox.

481
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,160
They gamified going to inbox zero.

482
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,680
And that's how they charge $30 a month

483
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,100
for it.

484
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,840
This is what level 6 is all about.

485
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,220
The technology doesn't change.

486
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,320
The framing doesn't change.

487
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,860
Hell, the design might not even change.

488
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,600
But the right strategic decision here

489
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,160
can create billions of dollars worth of company.

490
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,560
And now we finally get to level 7.

491
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:23,260
This is Steve Jobs kind of territory.

492
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:26,180
Get rid of all these buttons and just

493
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,260
make a giant screen.

494
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,560
See, at the time, this sounded insane.

495
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,640
Blackberry was king.

496
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,160
Physical keyboards were essential.

497
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,360
The idea that you could type accurately on

498
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:34,740
a touchscreen

499
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,220
was considered fantasy.

500
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,260
And here's the thing.

501
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,840
It wasn't even a new idea.

502
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,200
In 1984, a company called General Magic

503
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,380
spun off from Apple and shipped the Sonic

504
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,000
Magic Link,

505
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,680
a handheld device with a touchscreen

506
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,780
where you could do email, calendar, notes,

507
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,160
the first smartphone 13 years before the iPhone.

508
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,420
And it flopped.

509
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,980
So what is the difference here?

510
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,600
It's the same vision, the same bed,

511
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,320
but a completely different outcome.

512
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,540
The difference was everything underneath.

513
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:02,020
General Magic, just like Steve Jobs a few

514
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:02,560
years later,

515
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,820
had level 7.

516
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,760
It's a crazy product vision.

517
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,540
Something that completely changes things.

518
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,060
But they didn't have all the layers underneath.

519
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,920
And the difference between Steve Jobs and the

520
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:12,420
iPhone team

521
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,240
and everyone else is all the levels underneath.

522
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,560
It's going to level 6 and reframing the

523
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:17,800
phone

524
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,180
from a device that makes calls

525
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,700
to a computer in your pocket.

526
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,020
Not a phone with apps, but apps with

527
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:23,340
a phone.

528
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,120
It's going back to level 5.

529
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,360
The structural decision that everything is an app,

530
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,380
no file system, no complex desktop-like UI,

531
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:33,860
everything is in this neat grid of apps.

532
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,080
It's going back to level 4, the defaults.

533
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,220
The App Store ships with Apple's apps front

534
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:38,660
and center.

535
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,860
Safari defaults to Google.

536
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,960
The home button always takes you home.

537
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,080
And of course, you need level 3,

538
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,100
the technical innovation.

539
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,440
Capacitive multi-touch that actually works.

540
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,900
Gorilla Glass that doesn't break.

541
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,260
A battery that lasts a day.

542
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,460
And going back to level 2,

543
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,620
the interactions, inventing pinch to zoom,

544
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,660
slide to unlock,

545
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,940
the rubber band bouncy feel when you scroll

546
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:57,440
too far.

547
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,020
And all the way to level 1,

548
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,160
the details, the squircles on every icon,

549
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,180
the weight of the animation.

550
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,720
And Ken Cosienta, an engineer with a deadline,

551
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,620
fingered out that you need to make

552
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,480
the invisible hitboxes of the keyboard

553
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,700
dynamically bigger based on the letter you were

554
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,020
typing.

555
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,160
Otherwise, your keyboard wouldn't work.

556
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,080
But what you saw is just the beginning.

557
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,540
This video is part of a series

558
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,960
where we go behind the scenes of the

559
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,200
design,

560
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:19,180
engineering, and psychology

561
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,920
of the tech that we use every day.

562
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:23,220
And how even things that look so simple

563
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:23,760
and stupid

564
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,620
hide an absurd amount of complexity.

565
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,580
And you can find the next video right

566
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:27,840
here.
