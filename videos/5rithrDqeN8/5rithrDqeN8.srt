00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
Hi, I'm Zhilin, the founder of Kimi. Six

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,560
months ago, we released Kimi K2. It was

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,000
the first open model to scale pertaining to

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,880
one trillion parameters. Later, we introduced Kimi K2

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,820
Thinking. It scaled the thinking time of agents

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,900
for solving long horizon tasks. It performed interleaved

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,840
thinking with tool calling for up to 300

8
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,800
steps, all on its own. Today, we're dropping

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,840
our latest model, Kimi K2.5. K2.5

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,920
is a powerful model that

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:34,040
excels at agents, coding, vision, and general capabilities,

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,560
and it is open source. K2.5 sets

13
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,200
new records on the most challenging agentic benchmarks,

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,900
including Humanities Last Exam, Browse Comp, and Deep

15
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:49,320
Search QA. K2.5 is also a very

16
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,000
strong coding model. We didn't just want Kimi

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,200
to code, we wanted it to have an

18
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,500
eye for design. It weaves designer-grade websites,

19
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,840
a flow with great

20
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,240
face, and visual poetry. K2.5 and visual

21
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,300
poetry. K2.5 lowers the barrier of entry

22
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,740
with the vision capabilities. Simply upload a screen

23
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,480
recording. Kimi K2.5 will rebuild it from

24
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,400
scratch with clean professional code. Going beyond front

25
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:18,440
-end design, K2.5 is great at software

26
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,620
engineering. Kimi Code is our new coding product.

27
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,220
Kimi Code supports images and videos as inputs.

28
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,240
It also automatically discovers existing skills into your

29
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:29,580
working

30
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,140
environment in the environment in Kimi Code. Next,

31
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,720
Office. To make Kimi even more helpful in

32
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,640
your daily workflow, K2.5 has mastered the

33
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,400
core skills of the Office Suite. Whether it

34
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,440
is building a complex financial model, handling the

35
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,660
formatting of a professional PDF, or crafting a

36
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,640
consulting-level deck, we want to give that

37
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,440
power to everyone. Tasks that used to take

38
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,220
days, like merging 50 different department reports, or

39
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,060
turning a 30,000

40
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,680
work paper into a precise pitch deck, now

41
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,160
happen in 10 minutes. With K2.5, we

42
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,060
go from one agent to an agent's room.

43
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,100
Instead of asking one agent to do everything,

44
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,980
K2.5 creates and coordinates each room of

45
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:17,280
specialized agents to work in parallel.

46
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,180
These specialized agents are essentially copies of K2

47
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,120
.5, but with different roles and different subtasks.

48
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,200
Nothing is predefined. The roles and subtasks are

49
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,600
created on the fly

50
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,180
by K2.5. Running in parallel substantially reduces

51
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,980
the time needed for a complex task. For

52
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,060
market research spanning 100 companies, it orchestrates a

53
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,360
swarm of analysts for 10 around in minutes,

54
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,100
not weeks. For complex translation projects of 300

55
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,060
pages, it mobilizes a team of linguists for

56
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:51,140
rapid, accurate delivery. For literature synthesis across 50

57
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:54,860
papers, it fills 10 senior researchers to conduct

58
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,920
parallel analysis and generate a comprehensive survey.

59
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,920
Instantly. Training the agent swamps at scale is

60
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,300
technically challenging. We rebuild our reinforcement learning infrastructure

61
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,540
and optimize the training algorithms to ensure the

62
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,340
best efficiency and performance.

63
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:14,800
All of these capabilities come together in K2

64
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,420
.5, a powerful open source model. You can

65
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:21,740
experience all of this starting today on K2

66
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,320
.5 or the K2.5 app. For software

67
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,340
engineers, we recommend pairing K2.5 with K2

68
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:27,640
.5.

69
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,760
And also K2.5 is available via our

70
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,040
API. Go play with it and tell us

71
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,500
what you think. Thanks.
