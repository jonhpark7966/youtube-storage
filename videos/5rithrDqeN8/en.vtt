00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
Hi, I'm Zhilin, the founder of Kimi. Six

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.560
months ago, we released Kimi K2. It was

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.000
the first open model to scale pertaining to

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.880
one trillion parameters. Later, we introduced Kimi K2

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.820
Thinking. It scaled the thinking time of agents

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.900
for solving long horizon tasks. It performed interleaved

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.840
thinking with tool calling for up to 300

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.800
steps, all on its own. Today, we're dropping

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.840
our latest model, Kimi K2.5. K2.5

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.920
is a powerful model that

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.040
excels at agents, coding, vision, and general capabilities,

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.560
and it is open source. K2.5 sets

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.200
new records on the most challenging agentic benchmarks,

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.900
including Humanities Last Exam, Browse Comp, and Deep

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.320
Search QA. K2.5 is also a very

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.000
strong coding model. We didn't just want Kimi

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.200
to code, we wanted it to have an

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.500
eye for design. It weaves designer-grade websites,

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.840
a flow with great

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.240
face, and visual poetry. K2.5 and visual

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.300
poetry. K2.5 lowers the barrier of entry

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.740
with the vision capabilities. Simply upload a screen

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.480
recording. Kimi K2.5 will rebuild it from

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.400
scratch with clean professional code. Going beyond front

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.440
-end design, K2.5 is great at software

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.620
engineering. Kimi Code is our new coding product.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.220
Kimi Code supports images and videos as inputs.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.240
It also automatically discovers existing skills into your

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.580
working

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.140
environment in the environment in Kimi Code. Next,

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.720
Office. To make Kimi even more helpful in

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.640
your daily workflow, K2.5 has mastered the

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.400
core skills of the Office Suite. Whether it

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.440
is building a complex financial model, handling the

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.660
formatting of a professional PDF, or crafting a

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.640
consulting-level deck, we want to give that

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.440
power to everyone. Tasks that used to take

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.220
days, like merging 50 different department reports, or

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.060
turning a 30,000

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.680
work paper into a precise pitch deck, now

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.160
happen in 10 minutes. With K2.5, we

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.060
go from one agent to an agent's room.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.100
Instead of asking one agent to do everything,

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.980
K2.5 creates and coordinates each room of

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.280
specialized agents to work in parallel.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.180
These specialized agents are essentially copies of K2

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.120
.5, but with different roles and different subtasks.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.200
Nothing is predefined. The roles and subtasks are

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.600
created on the fly

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.180
by K2.5. Running in parallel substantially reduces

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.980
the time needed for a complex task. For

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.060
market research spanning 100 companies, it orchestrates a

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.360
swarm of analysts for 10 around in minutes,

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.100
not weeks. For complex translation projects of 300

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.060
pages, it mobilizes a team of linguists for

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.140
rapid, accurate delivery. For literature synthesis across 50

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.860
papers, it fills 10 senior researchers to conduct

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.920
parallel analysis and generate a comprehensive survey.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.920
Instantly. Training the agent swamps at scale is

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.300
technically challenging. We rebuild our reinforcement learning infrastructure

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.540
and optimize the training algorithms to ensure the

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.340
best efficiency and performance.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.800
All of these capabilities come together in K2

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.420
.5, a powerful open source model. You can

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.740
experience all of this starting today on K2

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.320
.5 or the K2.5 app. For software

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.340
engineers, we recommend pairing K2.5 with K2

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.640
.5.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.760
And also K2.5 is available via our

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.040
API. Go play with it and tell us

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.500
what you think. Thanks.
