1
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,420
Domestic helper bots are coming.

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,519
Billions is being poured into this new

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,939
AI frontier.

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:12,039
A global gold rush underway.

5
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,580
Go make us a cup of coffee.

6
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:17,929
But how close actually are we to

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:21,109
the sci-fi dream of a robot butler?

8
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:23,049
Oh, holy, I've never seen this in my

9
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:24,149
whole life.

10
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,309
Actually, let us start with another

11
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:26,789
task and we will come back to this.

12
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,389
Good accuracy.

13
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:31,829
Oh, I spoke too soon.

14
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:36,649
So this is it, but

15
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,109
it's a normal house on a normal street.

16
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,169
But that kind of makes sense, doesn't

17
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,070
it? They're building a robot for homes.

18
00:00:45,269 --> 00:00:46,539
Hi, Bipasha, how are you?

19
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:47,540
Good, how are you?

20
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:50,559
Can you describe what we're

21
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,399
seeing here then?

22
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,599
So you've got the robot off camera,

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,779
there's someone wearing some

24
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:58,139
of the similar kit.

25
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,140
How's it all working?

26
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,759
So we have

27
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,919
a teleoperator who

28
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,919
is wearing a

29
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,539
suit to teleoperate the robot.

30
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,379
Ideally, it should have its own mind.

31
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,339
I mean, it sees a mess.

32
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:14,399
It should be able to go and clean it up

33
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,900
because it thinks it's messy.

34
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:18,480
And it should know what to do.

35
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,539
Right now, it is getting

36
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,540
trained to do that.

37
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,799
As an MIT robotics dropout, Bipasha

38
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,839
spun out a student project, quickly

39
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,879
convincing investors to put money into

40
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,298
her vision.

41
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,579
We believe today people have

42
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:35,619
two aspirations, usually like a car and

43
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,759
a house.

44
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,919
In the future they'll have three

45
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,679
aspirations, a car, a house and a

46
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,680
robot.

47
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,599
A few miles away, also in Palo Alto,

48
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,439
another company has trained its bot to

49
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,679
do some tasks completely on its own.

50
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:49,859
.

51
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,060
Tony, how's it going?

52
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,099
Wow, it's a home.

53
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,159
Tony Zhao began working on his home

54
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,359
robot while at uni, but dropped out

55
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,720
to build Memo full-time.

56
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,109
Hi, I'm Memo your future home robot

57
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:04,849
here at Sunday.

58
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,829
So can it

59
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:09,209
see me around it?

60
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:10,049
Yeah it can.

61
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,229
Right now it doesn't react to you, but

62
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,229
it can perceive the world with all the

63
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,109
cameras and other sensors.

64
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,849
Can you just go make us a cup of

65
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:18,850
coffee?

66
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,069
It's after 2 p.m.

67
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,469
Would you like me to go ahead and make

68
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,710
that cup of coffee for you?

69
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:27,249
Yes, please go ahead.

70
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,249
I'm on it.

71
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,250
Making your coffee now.

72
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,179
So Tony, can I just check with you?

73
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,299
There's no one that we can't see

74
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,559
doing this for the robot.

75
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,629
This is all autonomous.

76
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,389
Yes, it's one single neural network

77
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,509
controlling the whole body movement.

78
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:00,369
It was all going smoothly,

79
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,429
then Tony paused the demo as he

80
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,909
saw something was off.

81
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,549
Maybe we need to restart this.

82
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,590
Can I restart this?

83
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,489
I think there is a...

84
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,249
Can you stop it?

85
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,389
I think we might need to do it

86
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,549
again. I saw there is some peeling off

87
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,129
here. Sorry about that.

88
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,249
Let's just try again.

89
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,550
Maybe I'm overly cautious.

90
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,179
Oh, holy, oh,

91
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,879
I've never seen this in my whole life.

92
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,749
After a reset, Memo smoothly cleared

93
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,750
away the table.

94
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,089
There's obviously work to be done to

95
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:45,849
get it ready for homes, but there's no

96
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,589
doubt this is one of the most capable

97
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,590
bots in the world.

98
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,599
How have you got the robot to

99
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,999
be this advanced?

100
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,249
How have done it?

101
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,109
Normally, the way we train AI is

102
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,189
to tele-operate the robot in

103
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,989
people's homes or in other places and

104
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:07,289
gather the data and train the AI.

105
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,869
And what we're doing is different, as

106
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,809
in we don't need robot data to train

107
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,789
the robot. And instead, we build these

108
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,569
gloves. And people just wear their

109
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,648
gloves in their homes and collect data

110
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:18,969
for us. And that give us really diverse

111
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:20,648
data because we now see like more than

112
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:21,648
500 homes.

113
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:23,469
And also all the different ways they go

114
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,869
about doing the task.

115
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,929
Sunday's army of robot teachers are all

116
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,969
being paid to do repetitive,

117
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,069
everyday tasks, a reminder of the

118
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,969
human drudgery underpinning how these

119
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,589
machines learn.

120
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,649
The staff allow cameras and sensors to

121
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,429
record their every move at home, but

122
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,189
Sunday plans to start shipping memos

123
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,169
next year, so if the

124
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,049
bot needs to be remotely controlled it

125
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,909
will raise privacy considerations for

126
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:47,929
customers, as well as questions about

127
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:50,089
safety in a domestic setting.

128
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:51,689
Like, they will be kids running around,

129
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,389
kids will be climbing on the robot,

130
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:55,669
right? So we really want to make sure

131
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,209
that we put safety

132
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,149
as the most fundamental consideration

133
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,170
when we design these robots.

134
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,249
Some robotics companies are already

135
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,109
out in the wild, gathering training

136
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,209
data in public.

137
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,669
Isaac's been trained by watching

138
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,689
hundreds of hours of laundry folding.

139
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,209
For the last couple of months though,

140
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,149
it's been doing it on its own for real,

141
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,149
here, and in six other sites in San

142
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,150
Francisco.

143
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:25,129
Deployment is the strategy.

144
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,569
Nothing counts if it's sequestered

145
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,889
away in a lab.

146
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,629
This is the very task that we'll also

147
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,629
be doing in homes.

148
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,189
And here we get to prove that it works

149
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,049
in the real world, bring down the time

150
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,479
per article of clothing that we mold.

151
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,759
Here's a t-shirt, we'll do a live

152
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,199
demonstration. There we are, okay.

153
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,199
So this is a lot slower than a human.

154
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,459
So some people might be watching this

155
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,699
saying, oh, that's not very impressive,

156
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,159
but can you tell us why it is

157
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,979
impressive?

158
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,219
It is impressive because this thing can

159
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,279
run all day.

160
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,219
You often hear that robots are best

161
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,359
suited to tasks that are dull, dirty,

162
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,360
or dangerous.

163
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,179
We wanna make clothing folding

164
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,609
optional for people.

165
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:03,949
Oh, here we go.

166
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,029
Hang on a second.

167
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,029
Struggling with a little bit at the end

168
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:06,979
there.

169
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,339
You know, we kind of

170
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,619
care about getting a

171
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,699
presentation right.

172
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,019
That is way better than I would do it.

173
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,839
When you first put this robot here,

174
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,069
how long did it take to do one t-shirt?

175
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,051
I think that we were looking at 2-

176
00:06:23,052 --> 00:06:23,259
2.30.

177
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,319
So already what, in how many

178
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,299
months?

179
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,089
That's in a month and a half.

180
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,749
In a month and a half, you've got down

181
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,329
to 1.30, just over 1.30.

182
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:33,409
We've planned to start shipping Isaacs

183
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,849
to homes this year.

184
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,909
They say it'll be able to tidy up and

185
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,729
fold laundry, but it's not clear how

186
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,050
much of that will be autonomous.

187
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:42,749
I actually didn't know how to do it

188
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,560
properly until I saw this.

189
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:51,249
Across town, at Physical Intelligence,

190
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,449
they're not interested in building

191
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:53,789
robots themselves.

192
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,429
They're focused on creating the AI

193
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,409
software that can be used to make any

194
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,229
robot capable of doing chores

195
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,230
autonomously.

196
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:03,549
The rest of AI, like in ChatGBT

197
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,589
for example, we're used to

198
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:07,889
training these models on an internet

199
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:09,909
of data, but we don't have that web

200
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,469
of data for robotics.

201
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,389
So we want to be able to actually, kind

202
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,649
of essentially breathe intelligence

203
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:16,749
into any sort of physical embodiment,

204
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,269
whether that's kind of a standard

205
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:20,389
typical robot, a humanoid robot,

206
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,429
or even something that looks closer to

207
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,639
an appliance, for example.

208
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,239
Like all these companies, Chelsea and

209
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,519
her team are developing their AI

210
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,619
software using reams of videos of

211
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,199
humans doing chores.

212
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,799
Their approach is proving successful.

213
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,799
Investors like AI giant OpenAI

214
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,259
are on board.

215
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,359
Another tech giant, Tesla, is deep

216
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,199
in development of its own humanoid

217
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,619
robot, Optimus.

218
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,119
But it's not yet clear what it can do.

219
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,519
And it's just not in the US where

220
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,979
people are getting excited about

221
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,119
human-like robots.

222
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,319
Chinese company Unitree is

223
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,179
already dominating the market with its

224
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,119
G1 robot.

225
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,159
Seen here in a demo given to us by

226
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,149
its UK seller, Scan.

227
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,389
This is happening right now.

228
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,629
People are buying them, people are

229
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:01,609
coding on them and people are

230
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:02,610
learning.

231
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,019
It's entirely operational.

232
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,099
It's not autonomous at all, as

233
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,100
of yet.

234
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,439
It's hard to get into China to film,

235
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,599
but the humanoid robot industry is so

236
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,359
hot there that the government recently

237
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,479
warned a bubble might be building set

238
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,480
to burst.

239
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,839
What's really interesting driving

240
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:20,259
around and speaking to all these

241
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,219
robotics companies in Silicon Valley is

242
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,179
there's a lot of confidence.

243
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,799
They think they are building the future

244
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,859
and they're certain it's going to be a

245
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,079
huge moneymaker.

246
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,239
But there's also some nervousness as

247
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,729
well because there's lots of things

248
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,609
that we wanted to film and we wanted to

249
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,048
show, but we can't.

250
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:37,369
They are scared because, of course,

251
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,428
this is a race, a race to bring

252
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:40,889
to market a domestic robot.

253
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:44,589
A company that hopes to be the first is

254
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,609
1X.

255
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,209
The Norwegian-founded company moved

256
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:49,329
here last year, and millions of dollars

257
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,329
are riding on its spot Neo, becoming a

258
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,330
hit.

259
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,609
We've just walked up to see Neo in

260
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,889
action, and someone is

261
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,929
operating Neo right now and watering

262
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,369
all the plants. I've just been told

263
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:01,649
this is what they do all day.

264
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,789
So there are people in the office

265
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,789
operating Neo with a

266
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:07,829
VR headset, carrying out tasks

267
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,149
and testing all day long.

268
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,219
Good accuracy.

269
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,619
Oh, spoke too soon.

270
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,089
So interestingly, Nio is struggling

271
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:29,309
with this particular handle,

272
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,089
but the team here change the handles

273
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:33,189
all the time because they're trying to

274
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,869
train the robot different ways to open

275
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:35,870
different handles.

276
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,709
They had it there.

277
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:41,189
Founder Bernt Børnich is pushing hard

278
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,989
to get Neo out to homes.

279
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,909
He says thousands of people have

280
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,049
already pre-ordered.

281
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,349
So what can Neo do right now

282
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,069
for me in my home?

283
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:51,849
Yeah, so let me tell you what Neo does

284
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,029
in my home.

285
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,089
So does a pretty good job of

286
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,009
like tidying.

287
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,809
So like resetting my living room and my

288
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,549
house in general.

289
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:01,009
Wiping surfaces, like cleaning the

290
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,530
counter, like these kind of things.

291
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,689
And that's all someone with a VR

292
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:07,389
headset. It's a mix.

293
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:09,369
It's mix. So in my own, we have

294
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,349
a lot of data.

295
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,829
So a lot other stuff in my can get

296
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:13,349
automated because we have data there.

297
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,969
Periodically, someone kind of steps in

298
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,949
and helps if the robot does not know

299
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,939
exactly how to move on.

300
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,379
Early adopters will have to be

301
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,819
comfortable then, waiving their

302
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,719
privacy.

303
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,359
But Bernt promises that Neo will be

304
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,839
able to carry out many tasks

305
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,799
autonomously by the time they start

306
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,819
shipping it.

307
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,500
Your first set of customers then, they

308
00:10:30,501 --> 00:10:32,559
have to quite wealthy and they have be

309
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,479
willing for Nio to make mistakes

310
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,679
essentially. Well I don't think they

311
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,659
have quite wealthy, I think.

312
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,999
It's £20,000 isn't it?

313
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,600
I don't know how much it is, £20.000?

314
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,709
Yeah, like, most people have a

315
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,710
car?

316
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:46,829
so you liken it to a car.

317
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:48,090
For a very large subset of that, it

318
00:10:48,091 --> 00:10:49,749
will be way higher value than having a

319
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:50,669
second car.

320
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:53,109
Getting the right customers is

321
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,029
more important in the beginning.

322
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,249
Distribution with the right customer,

323
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,649
so we can really use these amazing

324
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,749
people that are early adopters to

325
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,750
help us make this work.

326
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,969
Outside of the tech bubble, some,

327
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,409
including the International Federation

328
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:08,889
of Robotics, think it could take 20

329
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:10,949
years before domestic bots become

330
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:13,449
truly useful and accepted.

331
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,249
But we have heard that before about

332
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,349
other futuristic AI technologies.

333
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,619
Fasten you seatbelt please.

334
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:23,369
In some ways, brand new revolutionary

335
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,149
technology does just sort of creep up

336
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,649
on you. If you think about driverless

337
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,149
cars, I've been talking about driver

338
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,989
less cars in my reporting for a decade

339
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,269
at least, but now they're here.

340
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:34,269
And they're just sort normal.

341
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:36,389
In many cities across the US and in

342
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,449
China, driverless car are an

343
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:39,549
everyday sight.

344
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,509
AI robotics companies are convinced

345
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,489
their tech will go the same way.

346
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,069
And not only will their devices be

347
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:48,049
truly useful, we'll all eventually

348
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,490
want one in our homes.
