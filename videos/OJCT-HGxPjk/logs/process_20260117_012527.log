2026-01-17 01:26:13,801 - INFO -   | [05:31.400 --> 05:37.080]  it still doesn't address the bottleneck we could have had robots operating you know chopping vegetables
2026-01-17 01:26:13,802 - INFO -   | [05:37.080 --> 05:43.460]  or doing cooking even with simple grippers before the problem is that we don't have the intelligence

2026-01-17 01:26:13,802 - INFO -   | [05:56.060 --> 06:01.140]  fundamental challenge of robots not being intelligent i see so hardware may raise the ceiling on what you're
2026-01-17 01:26:13,802 - INFO -   | [06:01.140 --> 06:06.180]  able to do but like the the capability floor we're not even there yet that's right so even with simple

2026-01-17 01:26:19,948 - INFO -   | [06:23.860 --> 06:29.060]  further so what's the next layer of the okay what's the bottleneck for solving intelligence generalization
2026-01-17 01:26:19,948 - INFO -   | [06:29.640 --> 06:35.920]  it's a it's a good question um so we thought about it in terms of three factors we refer to them
2026-01-17 01:26:19,948 - INFO -   | [06:35.920 --> 06:44.740]  as capability generalization and performance with capability our our idea was that we want to get to

2026-01-17 01:26:19,948 - INFO -   | [06:54.580 --> 07:01.360]  we've gotten to fairly quickly um this was our pi zero release around a year ago or so showing that

2026-01-17 01:26:19,948 - INFO -   | [07:22.040 --> 07:26.920]  and this is a really really difficult problem right like if you if you put a robot in a new home it
2026-01-17 01:26:19,948 - INFO -   | [07:26.920 --> 07:31.700]  needs to understand you know where different items are the counters look different the lighting is

2026-01-17 02:09:12,757 - INFO -   | Title: Training General Robots for Any Task: Physical Intelligence’s Karol Hausman and Tobi Springenberg
2026-01-17 02:09:12,757 - INFO -   | Description: Physical Intelligence’s Karol Hausman and Tobi Springenberg believe that robotics has been held back not by hardware limitations, but by an intelligence bottleneck that foundation models can solve. Their end-to-end learning approach combines vision, language, and action into models like π0 and π*0.6, enabling robots to learn generalizable behaviors rather than task-specific programs. The team prioritizes real-world deployment and uses RL from experience to push beyond what imitation learning alone can achieve. Their philosophy—that a single general-purpose model can handle diverse physical tasks across different robot embodiments—represents a fundamental shift in how we think about building intelligent machines for the physical world.

2026-01-17 02:09:52,880 - INFO -   | The user has shared a file with a prompt for translating metadata to Korean. I'm wondering what they want—perhaps they’re looking for a translation result or to update the prompt. Since they haven’t specified, it seems like I should ask for clarification. Should I check if they want to run the translation or adjust the existing prompt? I think they might want to generate translated metadata JSON for that video, especially since it's likely related to YouTube.

2026-01-17 02:09:52,880 - INFO -   | I need to confirm the proper nouns and product names from the content. This includes "Physical Intelligence," and the names "Karol Hausman" and "Tobi Springenberg," along with "Alfred Lin" and "Sonya Huang" and "Sequoia Capital." I'll keep these as they are. There are model names like π0 and π*0.6, and I should maintain those too. For "RL," I might keep that abbreviation but include the full term "reinforcement learning" in translation. Overall, I need to create a strict JSON format with Korean translations for the title and description without extra whitespace. Let's proceed carefully!

2026-01-17 02:09:52,880 - INFO -   | Next, for the description, I’m tasked with translating two paragraphs without adding any new content. I should maintain the model names π0 and π*0.6, using quotes effectively. The original description highlights the innovative approach of Physical Intelligence’s team in combining various elements for robotics.

2026-01-17 02:09:52,880 - INFO -   | I’m creating the description based on the original content. Physical Intelligence's team believes that robotics has been hindered not by hardware limits but by an intelligence bottleneck that can be addressed by foundation models. Their end-to-end learning approach combines vision, language, and action into models like π0 and π*0.6, allowing robots to learn generalizable behaviors rather than just task-specific ones. The team emphasizes deploying in real-world environments and uses RL from experience to push past the limitations of imitation learning. I should ensure not to add content, so I’ll use "주최" instead of "진행합니다" and adjust terms for clarity, like "로봇의 다양한 구현(embodiments)."
