1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
This year at CES, Intel brought its latest laptop processors.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,772
Intel’s 3rd-gen Core Ultra processors.

3
00:00:05,772 --> 00:00:07,357
Codenamed Panther Lake.

4
00:00:07,357 --> 00:00:11,428
This is the first new product you can buy that uses Intel’s 18A process.

5
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:14,731
This processor’s performance will directly decide whether Intel’s process is

6
00:00:14,731 --> 00:00:16,332
truly Great Again.

7
00:00:16,332 --> 00:00:21,287
And its specs are also clearly different from Intel’s previous standard-power laptop processors.

8
00:00:21,287 --> 00:00:26,459
Today we’ll use this Lenovo Xiaoxin Pro 16 GT AI Yuanqi Edition that packs it,

9
00:00:26,459 --> 00:00:32,932
to take a good look at how this 18A flagship, which Intel is pinning big hopes on, really performs.

10
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:34,401
How good is the efficiency?

11
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:36,503
Enough talk, let’s officially get started.

12
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:40,256
In a previous episode, we already introduced the improvements to the 18A process.

13
00:00:40,256 --> 00:00:44,561
Simply put, it’s Intel’s first post-FinFET-era product.

14
00:00:44,561 --> 00:00:47,897
It’s Intel’s first GAA transistor process.

15
00:00:47,897 --> 00:00:52,068
And it also uses Intel’s PowerVia back-side power delivery technology.

16
00:00:52,068 --> 00:00:55,371
So the efficiency of this new processor should be something to look forward to.

17
00:00:55,371 --> 00:00:58,691
Next, come with me and take a look at Panther Lake’s specs.

18
00:00:58,691 --> 00:01:02,228
As Intel’s biggest laptop-side product for the next year,

19
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:05,715
Panther Lake’s specs are quite different from before.

20
00:01:05,715 --> 00:01:07,667
For the CPU, in total core count,

21
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:10,086
a full-spec Panther Lake is still 16 cores.

22
00:01:10,086 --> 00:01:14,290
But it’s not the 6+8+2 layout of Arrow Lake and Meteor Lake.

23
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,861
This time the P-cores drop from 6 to 4.

24
00:01:17,861 --> 00:01:19,963
And the E-core count stays at 8.

25
00:01:19,963 --> 00:01:23,600
While the LPE cores go from 2 to 4.

26
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,769
Just looking at the spec changes, you’re definitely thinking,

27
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:27,070
isn’t this a step backward?

28
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,238
There are fewer P-cores.

29
00:01:28,238 --> 00:01:29,923
If you think that, you’re wrong.

30
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:34,928
These LPE cores aren’t like the LPE cores in Arrow Lake or Meteor Lake.

31
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,530
The previous LPE cores were placed in the SoC Tile.

32
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,066
In other words, they were separate from the main CPU.

33
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:44,821
That meant they couldn’t access the CPU’s L3 cache and SLC cache at all.

34
00:01:44,821 --> 00:01:45,555
And even funnier,

35
00:01:45,555 --> 00:01:48,725
almost no software could actually make use of those LPE cores.

36
00:01:48,725 --> 00:01:53,897
You could say back then the LPE cores were like the Android camp’s A5xx.

37
00:01:53,897 --> 00:01:56,015
In my view they were basically useless.

38
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:57,133
What’s worse is,

39
00:01:57,133 --> 00:02:00,753
Meteor Lake upgrading to Arrow Lake didn’t even change the SoC Tile,

40
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:04,591
so Arrow Lake basically inherited those two trash tiny cores.

41
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:06,776
You could say their most important contribution in Arrow Lake

42
00:02:06,776 --> 00:02:09,395
was just two extra boxes in Task Manager.

43
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:13,967
But Panther Lake’s LPE cores this time aren’t that weak stuff.

44
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,821
These new LPE cores are the same concept as the ones in Lunar Lake.

45
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:21,024
They’re proper E-cores in another cluster.

46
00:02:21,024 --> 00:02:23,243
They just don’t share the ring bus with the other cores.

47
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:26,796
But performance is almost the same as the other eight E-cores.

48
00:02:26,796 --> 00:02:28,865
And they can access the SLC cache as well.

49
00:02:28,865 --> 00:02:31,434
They can also be scheduled and used normally like other cores.

50
00:02:31,434 --> 00:02:32,435
Their clocks aren’t low either.

51
00:02:32,435 --> 00:02:33,253
With that,

52
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:34,754
Panther Lake’s CPU side

53
00:02:34,754 --> 00:02:37,790
is split into a performance cluster made up of P-cores plus E-cores,

54
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:40,293
and an efficiency cluster made up of four LPE cores,

55
00:02:40,293 --> 00:02:42,395
a combination of two clusters in total.

56
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:46,466
This design is mainly for better battery life and efficiency,

57
00:02:46,466 --> 00:02:51,454
because some light workloads can clearly be fully handled by today’s LPE cores.

58
00:02:51,454 --> 00:02:55,141
When they’re not needed, the performance cluster can save a lot of power.

59
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:58,628
This approach has already been fully validated on Lunar Lake.

60
00:02:58,628 --> 00:03:02,415
I believe it will effectively boost Panther Lake laptops’ battery-life potential.

61
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:04,968
We also tested the latency between the various cores.

62
00:03:04,968 --> 00:03:07,353
You can clearly see a tri-cluster style.

63
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:10,406
Latency between P-cores is in the 20–30 ns range.

64
00:03:10,406 --> 00:03:14,194
Between P-cores and E-cores it’s around 40–50 ns.

65
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,113
Between E-cores it’s about 100 ns.

66
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:19,933
Cross-cluster latency to the LPE cores is a bit higher,

67
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,901
coming in at around 125 ns.

68
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:25,822
Overall, you can clearly see the latency differences between different cores.

69
00:03:25,822 --> 00:03:28,191
Inter-core latency between E-cores is a bit higher than expected.

70
00:03:28,191 --> 00:03:31,527
Overall the latency is normal for a multi-cluster processor.

71
00:03:31,527 --> 00:03:33,796
As for improvements to the CPU core architectures specifically,

72
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,515
it’s more about optimization,

73
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:37,951
rather than a completely new design from scratch.

74
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:39,752
The Cougar Cove P-core architecture,

75
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:42,455
compared with the Lion Cove used in Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake,

76
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:43,856
improves branch prediction,

77
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:45,158
increases TLB capacity,

78
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:47,594
and adds more capability for memory disambiguation,

79
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:51,564
with the goal of fully realizing Lion Cove’s IPC potential.

80
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,601
After all, even though Lion Cove made quite a few architectural changes,

81
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:56,603
the IPC uplift wasn’t as high as expected.

82
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:59,956
So Cougar Cove is here to raise the ceiling.

83
00:03:59,956 --> 00:04:05,878
The Darkmont architecture for the E-cores and LPE cores is also developed from the previous-gen Skymont.

84
00:04:05,878 --> 00:04:08,765
Skymont left a deep impression on us last year.

85
00:04:08,765 --> 00:04:09,799
As a small core,

86
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:14,454
its same-clock performance was almost on par with Zen 4 and the Raptor Cove big cores.

87
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:17,357
Darkmont continues to strengthen Skymont on that basis,

88
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,859
including branch prediction, dynamic prefetch control,

89
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:23,012
improved microcode throughput, and memory disambiguation capability.

90
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:27,917
Darkmont’s decoder clusters also go from 20b instruction-stream width to 24b.

91
00:04:27,917 --> 00:04:29,869
Suppose I’m handling 8b-wide instructions,

92
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:32,388
Each cluster’s instruction throughput used to be only 2 IPC.

93
00:04:32,388 --> 00:04:34,257
Now it’s 3 IPC per cluster.

94
00:04:34,257 --> 00:04:36,259
Three decoders add up to 9 IPC.

95
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:38,728
For the already very wide Darkmont cores,

96
00:04:38,728 --> 00:04:41,197
in cases like this where a single instruction is relatively long,

97
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:43,216
it can significantly improve execution efficiency.

98
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:46,135
Panther Lake doesn’t just have major changes on the CPU side;

99
00:04:46,135 --> 00:04:49,455
the off-core parts of the entire SoC change even more dramatically.

100
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,808
One very important change is that

101
00:04:51,808 --> 00:04:55,778
the memory controller has finally returned to the CPU’s Compute Tile.

102
00:04:55,778 --> 00:04:59,082
Do you know how big a difference this makes?

103
00:04:59,082 --> 00:05:01,668
We measured the memory-access latency curves for each core,

104
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:02,635
and you can see that

105
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,722
it’s still paired with LPDDR5X memory as well.

106
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:11,811
On the ARL platform, latency at 128 MB depth reached 140 ns,

107
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:17,233
while on the PTL platform it drops straight to 100 ns!

108
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,235
That gap is absolutely huge.

109
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:20,720
You have to remember that with Arrow Lake,

110
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,222
the main reason desktop gaming performance fell off a cliff

111
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:25,875
was the memory-latency hit from the off-die memory controller.

112
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:31,064
Panther Lake clearly fixes a major issue from the previous generation.

113
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:33,366
Another very important improvement comes from the GPU.

114
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:36,736
First, Panther Lake’s iGPU moves to the brand-new Xe3 architecture

115
00:05:36,736 --> 00:05:38,821
and supports XeSS 4× frame generation.

116
00:05:38,821 --> 00:05:40,373
Depending on the spec positioning,

117
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:44,077
the currently announced Panther Lake processors include a CPU 4+0+4

118
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,095
paired with a low-power 4 Xe iGPU,

119
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,798
a CPU 4+8+4 paired with a 4 Xe iGPU,

120
00:05:48,798 --> 00:05:53,236
and a top-spec CPU 4+8+4 paired with a flagship 12 Xe iGPU.

121
00:05:53,236 --> 00:05:55,321
The SoC die paired with them is different as well,

122
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:57,874
so the number of PCIe lanes also differs.

123
00:05:57,874 --> 00:06:01,394
But unlike the Compute Tile, which uses Intel’s own 18A process,

124
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:05,915
the 12 Xe GPU Tile uses TSMC’s N3E process,

125
00:06:05,915 --> 00:06:09,886
while the 4 Xe GPU uses Intel’s own Intel 3 process.

126
00:06:09,886 --> 00:06:10,686
Likewise,

127
00:06:10,686 --> 00:06:12,538
the process nodes for the other parts are all different too.

128
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,308
The IO Tile uses TSMC’s N6 process,

129
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:17,293
and the Base Tile that connects all the chiplets

130
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:20,563
has also been upgraded from 22 nm to 14 nm.

131
00:06:20,563 --> 00:06:23,666
So, we’ve quickly looked through Panther Lake’s technical changes;

132
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:27,520
now it’s time to get to today’s review star,

133
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,391
the 3rd-gen Intel Core Ultra X9 388H.

134
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:35,328
Panther Lake’s naming rules have changed again compared to last gen.

135
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:39,165
This time, models with the 12 Xe big iGPU all end in an 8.

136
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:42,802
The three models using the full-fat 12 Xe B390 iGPU

137
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:45,855
have even changed their naming from Ultra 7 and Ultra 9 to

138
00:06:45,855 --> 00:06:49,992
Ultra X7 and X9 to reinforce the impression.

139
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:52,061
The Ultra X9 388H we tested this time

140
00:06:52,061 --> 00:06:54,030
is, across the entire Panther Lake lineup,

141
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:56,332
the fullest-spec and highest-performance version.

142
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:59,385
Its single-core boost clock is slightly lower than the previous 285H,

143
00:06:59,385 --> 00:07:01,154
dropping from 5.4 to 5.1.

144
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:04,257
Later in the performance tests we’ll also come back to single-core,

145
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,109
to see whether it got stronger or weaker.

146
00:07:06,109 --> 00:07:08,995
The boost clocks for the E-cores and LPE-cores are similar,

147
00:07:08,995 --> 00:07:10,913
with the LPE cores a bit lower.

148
00:07:10,913 --> 00:07:14,834
Under full all-core load, the P-cores can run at 4.8 GHz,

149
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:17,487
while the E-cores and LPE-cores are both 3.6 GHz.

150
00:07:17,487 --> 00:07:21,090
On the memory side, it supports LPDDR5X-9600,

151
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:24,994
which should be quite important for the 12 Xe iGPU’s performance.

152
00:07:24,994 --> 00:07:27,313
Next, it’s time to really put it to the test

153
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:30,416
and see how this Ultra X9 388H performs.

154
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:34,487
For testing, we used Lenovo’s Xiaoxin Pro 16 GT AI Yuanqi Edition.

155
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:37,523
This laptop uses a 16-inch 2.8K

156
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:39,842
120 Hz, 1100-nit OLED display

157
00:07:39,842 --> 00:07:42,278
and a huge 99.9 Wh battery.

158
00:07:42,278 --> 00:07:45,047
Inside, it uses a dual-heatpipe, dual-fan cooling module,

159
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,365
and for an iGPU-only model,

160
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:49,485
this cooling setup can basically unleash its full potential.

161
00:07:49,485 --> 00:07:54,140
It’s very suitable as our launch test machine for the new Core Ultra generation.

162
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,510
First, let’s look at SPEC CPU 2017.

163
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:59,045
Let’s start with the P-core results.

164
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:02,815
Even with lower clocks than the 285H,

165
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,534
the 388H actually scores higher.

166
00:08:04,534 --> 00:08:06,402
The big-core architectural changes are small,

167
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:08,771
but you can indeed see IPC gains,

168
00:08:08,771 --> 00:08:13,059
about 10% in integer and about 7% in floating point.

169
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:17,864
That’s a sizable uplift for an architecture without major changes.

170
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:21,651
The 388H’s E-cores and LPE-cores scored quite similarly,

171
00:08:21,651 --> 00:08:23,386
because the core microarchitecture is exactly the same.

172
00:08:23,386 --> 00:08:26,589
What affects their performance is only frequency and cache configuration.

173
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:30,026
You can see that this generation’s LPE-core performance is not weak,

174
00:08:30,026 --> 00:08:33,429
especially compared with the previous 285H’s LPE cores,

175
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:35,314
the gap is simply enormous.

176
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:37,266
E-core IPC has also improved further.

177
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:40,303
Most absurdly, if they both run at 3.8 GHz,

178
00:08:40,303 --> 00:08:44,257
the new E-cores’ IPC is even roughly on par with last gen’s P-cores.

179
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:48,344
And remember, this CPU has 12 such cores!

180
00:08:48,344 --> 00:08:50,263
From the SPEC2017 results,

181
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:53,566
Panther Lake’s P-core and E-core IPC both improve to some extent;

182
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:55,518
although peak frequency is slightly lower,

183
00:08:55,518 --> 00:08:57,236
single-core performance hasn’t regressed.

184
00:08:57,236 --> 00:09:00,556
So how does the X9 388H perform in more tests?

185
00:09:00,556 --> 00:09:02,658
First, let’s look at the Cinebench series.

186
00:09:02,658 --> 00:09:06,862
This time we tested three generations: R23, 2024, and 2026.

187
00:09:06,862 --> 00:09:11,817
You can see the 388H is slightly ahead of the previous 285H in both single-core and multi-core.

188
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:15,021
In the older R23, the advantage is a bit smaller.

189
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:17,974
HX370 is also slightly stronger than 388H in R23.

190
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:22,395
Overall, the three CPUs’ multi-core performance is in the same tier.

191
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,114
But during testing I noticed something interesting.

192
00:09:25,114 --> 00:09:27,083
In high-load tests like Cinebench,

193
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:31,921
this X9 388H never hit the 80W PL1 power limit.

194
00:09:31,921 --> 00:09:34,156
I thought it had run into some other limit,

195
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:38,561
but on a closer look, it turns out the frequency was already maxed out at full all-core turbo.

196
00:09:38,561 --> 00:09:42,181
In other words, its peak power was only 78W.

197
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:46,285
That’s a clear advantage compared to the previous 285H when it’s fully pushed.

198
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:48,904
And that advantage shows up directly in efficiency.

199
00:09:48,904 --> 00:09:50,773
On the Cinebench 2024 efficiency curve,

200
00:09:50,773 --> 00:09:53,726
this X9 388H versus the previous 285H

201
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,211
shows a significant improvement.

202
00:09:55,211 --> 00:09:57,597
Basically, at 45W,

203
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,416
it’s already reaching what the previous gen needed around 70W to achieve.

204
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:03,202
That multi-core efficiency gain is obviously huge.

205
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:05,288
If we compare it with HX370,

206
00:10:05,288 --> 00:10:08,991
you can see its efficiency is also slightly better than HX370’s.

207
00:10:08,991 --> 00:10:11,794
After all, HX370’s 12 Zen 5 cores

208
00:10:11,794 --> 00:10:14,981
with homogeneous big cores are still very strong in Cinebench.

209
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:17,450
In the older Cinebench R23,

210
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,852
the 388H’s efficiency improvement is also obvious,

211
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:22,088
but the gap isn’t as large as in 2024.

212
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:25,224
That’s mainly because R23 is less sensitive to memory,

213
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:27,126
and focuses more on raw CPU performance.

214
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:31,614
And one huge highlight of the 388H comes from the memory subsystem upgrade.

215
00:10:31,614 --> 00:10:34,984
Next, let’s look at another rendering test: Blender.

216
00:10:34,984 --> 00:10:38,537
The X9 388H has a small uplift over the previous 285H,

217
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:40,706
but is slightly behind HX370.

218
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:42,525
In the VS compile Dolphin test,

219
00:10:42,525 --> 00:10:46,162
the X9 388H is also improved versus 285H,

220
00:10:46,162 --> 00:10:49,765
and here the 388H is noticeably stronger than HX370.

221
00:10:49,765 --> 00:10:53,202
That result mainly comes down to stronger single-core and memory performance.

222
00:10:53,202 --> 00:10:56,072
Next up, 7-Zip compression and decompression.

223
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,324
Because the memory controller is back in the right place,

224
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,694
the 388H makes some performance gains in 7-Zip compression,

225
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:04,747
though decompression is slightly weaker than HX370.

226
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:06,532
Overall, it’s a bit of give-and-take.

227
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:08,284
In pure CPU performance tests,

228
00:11:08,284 --> 00:11:10,586
this Ultra X9 388H’s performance level

229
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:14,140
is basically a small step up from the previous 285H.

230
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,558
Compared with peak performance gains,

231
00:11:15,558 --> 00:11:18,494
the efficiency improvements this generation are more impressive.

232
00:11:18,494 --> 00:11:21,630
And that great efficiency isn’t just from the CPU;

233
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,417
its GPU is even more eye-opening.

234
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,419
In the 3DMark SNL efficiency test,

235
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:29,588
we also brought in the monster iGPU AI Max 395 for comparison.

236
00:11:29,588 --> 00:11:32,491
As you know, the 395’s 8060s iGPU

237
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:35,010
isn’t in the same class of specs as the other processors.

238
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,862
It’s clearly larger and more expensive,

239
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,764
but it still works as a reference point

240
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:42,051
to see just how strong the 388H’s GPU efficiency is.

241
00:11:42,051 --> 00:11:43,052
And it’s not hard to see that

242
00:11:43,052 --> 00:11:48,174
the 388H’s iGPU absolutely demolishes the previous 285H’s iGPU in efficiency.

243
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:53,412
Even at just 15W it can easily beat the previous gen running flat out.

244
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:57,066
It’s already close to double the performance of both 285H and HX370.

245
00:11:57,066 --> 00:12:01,187
This 12Xe big iGPU’s performance really caught me off guard.

246
00:12:01,187 --> 00:12:02,405
I knew it would be strong,

247
00:12:02,405 --> 00:12:04,123
but I didn’t expect it to be this strong.

248
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,459
Obviously, this is a big help for today’s thin-and-light iGPU laptops

249
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:09,779
and even for handheld gaming PCs.

250
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:13,399
Later we’ll also put this iGPU through real games

251
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,285
to see whether it’s a “high score, low real-world performance” kind of GPU.

252
00:12:16,285 --> 00:12:17,770
Looking at peak performance,

253
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:21,340
its SNL score is a major improvement over the previous iGPU.

254
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,509
So how does it compare with discrete GPUs?

255
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:27,246
We specifically found two laptops with full-power 95W 3050 Ti

256
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,332
and a 130W 3060 as references.

257
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:35,771
You can see that in SNL, this iGPU scores almost exactly the same as a full-power 3050 Ti.

258
00:12:35,771 --> 00:12:37,673
We also tested its performance in Time Spy,

259
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:42,244
and here the 388H’s Arc B390 iGPU score is pretty crazy—

260
00:12:42,244 --> 00:12:44,079
well ahead of the 3050 Ti.

261
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,350
But as you know, Intel iGPUs generally score unusually high in Time Spy,

262
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:53,439
so from what I’ve seen, SNL is a more cross-platform-relevant benchmark.

263
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,925
After looking at the GPU’s 3DMark performance,

264
00:12:55,925 --> 00:12:58,360
we also tested its rendering performance in Blender.

265
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,981
You can see it has evolved a lot compared to the previous gen,

266
00:13:01,981 --> 00:13:04,917
almost matching the AI Max 395’s iGPU.

267
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:08,254
And its score here is also about the same as the 3050 Ti.

268
00:13:08,254 --> 00:13:11,791
It seems the ray-tracing improvements across these two generations of Intel Xe graphics

269
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,776
also pay off in Blender.

270
00:13:13,776 --> 00:13:17,913
In Photoshop, the 388H laptop lands between the 285H and HX370 models.

271
00:13:17,913 --> 00:13:21,684
In After Effects, it pulls noticeably ahead of both 285H and HX370.

272
00:13:21,684 --> 00:13:25,688
And in the more GPU-heavy Premiere, it extends its lead even further.

273
00:13:25,688 --> 00:13:28,808
It looks like Panther Lake’s 12Xe big iGPU

274
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,426
Paired with a more powerful codec.

275
00:13:30,426 --> 00:13:34,213
It’s obviously very suitable for productivity uses like audio and video editing.

276
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:37,183
But if we’re talking about where the 12Xe iGPU really shines,

277
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:40,369
then we have to look at its performance in games.

278
00:13:40,369 --> 00:13:44,139
Let’s start with Arknights: Endfield, which just went online recently.

279
00:13:44,139 --> 00:13:46,609
Here we tested it at two quality presets.

280
00:13:46,609 --> 00:13:48,828
First is 1080P at the very lowest settings.

281
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:53,415
The X9 388H here even outperformed laptops with a 3060.

282
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:56,118
That’s actually because the other two ran into a CPU bottleneck.

283
00:13:56,118 --> 00:14:00,656
After all, the 11800H’s performance is a bit stretched thin today.

284
00:14:00,656 --> 00:14:03,175
At 2K resolution, the results are more representative.

285
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:06,078
You can see the iGPU in the 388H is seriously capable.

286
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:09,281
It’s 72% faster than the iGPU in the 285H.

287
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:10,232
That’s outrageous.

288
00:14:10,232 --> 00:14:13,669
It also easily beats the 95W 3050 Ti.

289
00:14:13,669 --> 00:14:16,472
Only slightly behind the much larger 3060.

290
00:14:16,472 --> 00:14:18,607
Next, let’s look at CS2.

291
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:22,027
As an FPS online game that puts plenty of load on both CPU and GPU,

292
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:27,149
the 388H is about 50% faster than 285H machines at both resolutions.

293
00:14:27,149 --> 00:14:30,736
But the strongest here are still the 3060 and 3050 Ti.

294
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:34,473
The HX370 also isn’t that far behind the 388H.

295
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:35,407
And pay attention to power draw.

296
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:38,878
At this level of performance it’s only around 45W.

297
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,430
That means a thin-and-light with even modest cooling

298
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:44,366
can let this 388H deliver full-power gaming performance.

299
00:14:44,366 --> 00:14:45,801
That’s the craziest part.

300
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:49,455
Next, let’s look at AAA games where the pressure is more concentrated on the GPU.

301
00:14:49,455 --> 00:14:50,956
Starting with Black Myth: Wukong.

302
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:53,108
At 1080P without upscaling,

303
00:14:53,108 --> 00:14:58,397
the 388H iGPU nearly doubles performance versus the 285H.

304
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:01,634
It’s almost identical to a full-power 3050 Ti.

305
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:03,586
And it’s much faster than the HX370 too.

306
00:15:03,586 --> 00:15:08,574
At 2K, turning on quality-mode upscaling like XeSS and DLSS,

307
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,894
the 388H still goes toe-to-toe with the 3050 Ti.

308
00:15:11,894 --> 00:15:14,980
XeSS is also very close to DLSS in quality.

309
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:19,385
Image quality is clearly better than the FSR supported by the 890M iGPU.

310
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:21,270
Black Myth puts less load on the CPU,

311
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:24,323
so the SoC power draw during testing was lower too.

312
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:27,376
In most cases it was only 35–40W.

313
00:15:27,376 --> 00:15:29,795
That efficiency is pretty astonishing.

314
00:15:29,795 --> 00:15:33,015
Next up, the classic AAA title, Cyberpunk 2077.

315
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:38,270
Here, the 388H also achieved nearly double the performance compared with the 285H.

316
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:42,441
Whether at 1080P without upscaling or at 2K+ with quality-mode upscaling,

317
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,044
this B390 iGPU performed extremely well.

318
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,479
Even at 2K with quality-mode XeSS,

319
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:49,365
thanks to more flexible VRAM management,

320
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:52,434
it has already pulled ahead of the 3050 Ti with 4GB of VRAM.

321
00:15:52,434 --> 00:15:54,553
It’s closer to 3060-level performance.

322
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:57,339
In the TGA Game of the Year—Expedition 33,

323
00:15:57,339 --> 00:16:02,594
the 388H also delivered close to a doubling in performance at both resolutions.

324
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:07,299
The 3050 Ti can still hang with the 388H at 1080P without upscaling.

325
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,134
But once you turn on upscaling at 2K,

326
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,203
4GB of VRAM immediately becomes a limitation.

327
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:16,191
So the 388H is able to overtake the 95W 3050 Ti.

328
00:16:16,191 --> 00:16:18,844
The same situation continues in Kingdom Come: Deliverance II.

329
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,663
The 388H’s B390 iGPU,

330
00:16:20,663 --> 00:16:23,282
whether at native 1080P

331
00:16:23,282 --> 00:16:26,468
or at 2K with quality-mode upscaling, performs very well.

332
00:16:26,468 --> 00:16:29,772
It can also deliver nearly double the performance of the 285H.

333
00:16:29,772 --> 00:16:31,373
The gaming experience it can provide

334
00:16:31,373 --> 00:16:36,545
is clearly worlds apart from traditional iGPUs like the HX370 and 285H.

335
00:16:36,545 --> 00:16:38,097
After testing several games,

336
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:42,001
Ultra X9 388H’s gaming performance left a deep impression on me.

337
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,004
This new 12Xe iGPU’s performance in real games

338
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,873
is as stunning as its performance in 3DMark SNL.

339
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:48,891
Compared to absolute performance,

340
00:16:48,891 --> 00:16:51,377
what’s more surprising is its efficiency in games.

341
00:16:51,377 --> 00:16:54,446
Basically, in games its power draw is around 30–50W.

342
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:57,149
That’s not much different from the previous-gen 285H.

343
00:16:57,149 --> 00:17:01,653
That means if a 14-inch laptop has about 65W of cooling capacity,

344
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:05,774
it’s enough to unleash almost all of the 388H’s potential.

345
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:06,975
In other words,

346
00:17:06,975 --> 00:17:09,128
an iGPU laptop with the 388H

347
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:14,516
can absolutely achieve nearly full, uncompromised gaming performance on battery.

348
00:17:14,516 --> 00:17:18,303
That’s something dGPU laptops are almost incapable of doing.

349
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:23,208
Take this Lenovo Xiaoxin Pro 16 GT AI (Yuanqi Edition) we have on hand as an example.

350
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:27,229
I specifically tested the frame rates in CS2 and Black Myth on battery.

351
00:17:27,229 --> 00:17:30,165
You can see the performance loss is very slight.

352
00:17:30,165 --> 00:17:32,484
And this is only on the launch BIOS.

353
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:34,937
After further tuning in future BIOS versions,

354
00:17:34,937 --> 00:17:38,273
I have every reason to believe laptops with Panther Lake

355
00:17:38,273 --> 00:17:43,245
can achieve exactly the same gaming performance on battery and on AC power.

356
00:17:43,245 --> 00:17:44,446
At this point in the testing,

357
00:17:44,446 --> 00:17:46,582
I believe you already have your own take on the performance of the Panther Lake architecture

358
00:17:46,582 --> 00:17:50,319
Core Ultra X9 388H.

359
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,956
In my view, this generation’s 12Xe is excellent,

360
00:17:53,956 --> 00:17:57,359
especially its efficiency, which left a very deep impression on me.

361
00:17:57,359 --> 00:17:59,244
Whether it’s the CPU or the GPU,

362
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,080
You can see that this generation’s direction of evolution is

363
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,133
moving toward lower power consumption and higher performance.

364
00:18:04,133 --> 00:18:05,584
That makes me very curious:

365
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:09,571
will this generation’s battery life also see a clear improvement?

366
00:18:09,571 --> 00:18:15,077
In the end, this Lenovo Xiaoxin Pro 16 GT AI Yuanqi Edition we have, at 120 Hz,

367
00:18:15,077 --> 00:18:19,131
ran for over 12 hours in our Geekerwan laptop battery-life model.

368
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:21,583
Even considering the battery capacity increased by 19%,

369
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:24,720
reaching 99.9 Wh, the maximum you can take on a plane,

370
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,657
it’s still easy to see this generation made a clear leap in endurance.

371
00:18:28,657 --> 00:18:33,028
We also tested battery life with the screen refresh rate set to 60 Hz.

372
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:35,948
It actually reached 14 and a half hours!

373
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:38,851
No wonder it’s an SoC that inherits Lunar Lake’s design philosophy.

374
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:42,654
I’d guess that this year, Windows iGPU laptops with Panther Lake

375
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:46,258
should have no trouble hitting 10 hours of battery life.

376
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,577
After finishing this launch-day testing,

377
00:18:48,577 --> 00:18:51,914
Panther Lake’s performance left a deep impression on me.

378
00:18:51,914 --> 00:18:53,098
On the CPU side,

379
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:55,801
Intel 18A’s debut performance is excellent,

380
00:18:55,801 --> 00:19:01,273
with efficiency even better than the 285H built on TSMC N3B.

381
00:19:01,273 --> 00:19:03,625
It gives people hope that Intel’s process tech is back on track.

382
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:06,094
On the GPU side, it gave us a big surprise:

383
00:19:06,094 --> 00:19:09,198
whether it’s gaming, productivity, or efficiency,

384
00:19:09,198 --> 00:19:13,352
among the SoCs currently available in the Windows camp, it’s second to none.

385
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:17,723
This generation of Panther Lake is a laptop SoC that strongly prioritizes efficiency.

386
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:22,477
It even makes me a bit worried about Qualcomm’s X2 Elite, still not officially launched—

387
00:19:22,477 --> 00:19:25,297
what approach it will use to compete.

388
00:19:25,297 --> 00:19:28,750
Now the only question is the pricing of Panther Lake models.

389
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:33,071
The Lenovo Xiaoxin Pro 16 GT AI Yuanqi Edition we tested today

390
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:34,940
will go on sale in China in March.

391
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,542
Something to look forward to.

392
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:39,261
Let’s see what the pricing ends up being then.

393
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:43,265
Alright, that’s everything for our Panther Lake launch-day testing.
