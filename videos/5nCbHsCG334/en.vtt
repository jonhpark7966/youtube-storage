WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
All right everybody we're thrilled to have the

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.360
one the only Satya Nadella here the third

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.480
CEO of Microsoft for a impromptu fireside chat

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.420
with David Sachs our czar of AI and

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:20.840
crypto Satya third CEO of Microsoft born in

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.400
India what an incredible story came here right

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.980
after college and you had a little round

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.820
trip to pick up your wife

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.720
in your book to bring her here tell

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.780
everybody briefly uh how that occurred well um

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.900
uh you know so that's that's a great

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.760
story of uh the uh the labyrinth that

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.940
is the immigration policies of the united states

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.300
i think um i uh but my wife

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.940
and i went to college together in india

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.000
i came here for grad school we then

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.040
got married uh i got my green card

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.800
um and she couldn't come join me

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.260
because we got married um because we got

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.440
married so the story goes basically i had

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.800
to give up my green card so the

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.680
funny thing is i went to the american

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.360
embassy in delhi and i said where's the

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.000
line to give up my green card and

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.460
they said there is no such a line

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.940
um that would be a crazy thing to

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.840
do in the 90s so it was a

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.520
strange thing to give up your green card

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.640
get an h1 so that she could join

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.760
but it all worked out so um you

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.780
know it's a long lost memory but it

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.780
was you know a way to work around

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.720
it um i wanted to ask

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.140
to ask you uh having launched a copilot

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.720
first with github then having a copilot on

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.420
the desktop you made a very bold move

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.660
for microsoft to put that in the windows

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.620
product which i use every day on the

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:47.320
desktop but you did that before it really

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.720
could recognize the file system and interact with

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.420
applications got a little bit of a lukewarm

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.300
reception but now you've been doubling down doubling

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.900
down and there seems to be

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.260
in my estimation three modalities for knowledge workers

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.200
elon's building at xai what they're calling a

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.880
human emulator if you saw that leak

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.940
this week yeah uh where they're just building

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.120
employees and just putting them into their chat

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.900
rooms and email

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.560
then you have claude came out with co

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.960
-work this week incredibly powerful people are kind

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:18.880
of losing their minds

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.560
over it i've been playing with it for

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.120
the last 40 hours truly impressive what's your

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.740
vision for

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.320
microsoft and how knowledge workers will actually put

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.580
this to use because there seems to be

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.340
a gap between

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.000
you know playing around with chat tpt and

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.020
getting some interesting results and getting business results

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.120
yeah so i think it one of the

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.520
most uh perhaps illustrative examples um of trying

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.200
to understand these

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.400
various form factors is looking at coding which

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.220
is obviously a form of knowledge work or

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.120
uh probably

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.420
the best example of knowledge work and if

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.460
you think about the journey coding has been

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.520
it started with

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.820
essentially uh uh the next edit suggest right

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.420
that was the first time in fact my

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.100
own belief in this entire

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.560
generation of tech really sort of got formulated

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.140
when i started seeing i think this you

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.760
know there's a

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.520
codex model back in the day it was

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.680
pre-gpt 3.5 uh that's when next

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.580
edit suggestions started working

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.920
with some real accuracy then we went to

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.140
chat then we went to actions and now

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.720
to full autonomous agents

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.680
and then the autonomous agents can be both

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.060
a foreground background in the cloud or local

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.800
right so that's

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.300
all the form factors that exist today when

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.000
you're coding and interestingly enough if you look

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.280
at it

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.560
you use all of them right it's not

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.620
like there's only one form factor so that's

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:41.340
i think probably one

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.720
of the other lessons so for example when

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.160
i'm in a cli i can you go

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.200
a foreground agent background agent

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.160
and then just literally go edit in vs

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.740
code right there all happening in parallel right

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:54.680
so that sort of

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.560
shows how these form factors even compose so

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.260
then you bring that to knowledge work to

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.160
your point we

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.460
started with chat chat with reasoning sort of

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.300
goes beyond just request response because you now

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.660
have

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.940
that chain of thought uh where you can

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.560
see it work now they're actions right essentially

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.200
either through

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.580
computer use or through uh if you know

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.160
basically skills uh and agent calls so you

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.180
can do actions so

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.980
that's kind of the state of the copilot

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.800
today now there is a way to think

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.780
about you know the the

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.060
theory of the mind evolution right because you

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.620
need like if you remember you know jobs

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.260
had the best

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.740
line i would say for pcs or computers

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.660
was to say if you it's a bicycle

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.840
for the mind uh bill had a line

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.760
which i liked as well which was it's

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.400
information at your fingertips we kind of need

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.420
now a new concept

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.600
metaphor for how we use computers in the

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.320
ai age and you have one and the

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.600
one i like actually came from

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.220
the ceo notion which i like you know

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.760
that manager of incredible product yeah you haven't

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.260
bought it yet

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.360
yeah i've not bought that uh but the

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.600
it's both even management you know basically um

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:09.380
a manager of

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.740
infinite minds that's a nice way to think

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:12.920
about it right when you sort of really

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:14.080
look at all the

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.100
agents that you are working with you kind

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.400
of need to understand what i in fact

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.860
the other term i like is we

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.220
macro delegate and micro steal in fact you

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.140
kind of need that in in in coding

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:28.100
you kind of have it right

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.240
so you do a macro delegation and then

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.540
i can in parallel give it instructions while

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:33.320
it is doing

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.480
work so that's sort of the state even

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.580
today of copilot or what have you you

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:39.800
bring up a little bit

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.380
of one of one of the form factors

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:43.020
i'm very excited about and you'll see us

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.700
even in the next week even

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.520
do things is while i'm sitting in github

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.520
copilot what it's not as if software developers

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.960
sit in

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.180
isolation right it's not like the only thing

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.380
i work on is my repo i attend

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.640
meetings um i write specs or

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.960
others have written specs that i'm implementing i

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.320
need to have my repo be consistent with

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.600
that

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.360
so that means using either a straightforward mcp

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.460
server or a skill i want to be

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:12.660
able to call into

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.460
my work iq which is the copilot bring

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.580
that in that's the type of composition uh

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:20.620
of knowledge work

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.720
that'll happen same thing with security say you're

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.720
a security professional you have lots of logs

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.300
uh

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.600
how do you sort of really analyze them

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.660
you drop them into a file system then

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:30.960
write code on top of

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.420
it create a dashboard what have you those

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.300
are the types of knowledge work that we

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:35.860
can enable

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.100
then i think you bring up one more

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.140
thing which is can you create quote unquote

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:41.200
digital employees

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.280
digital co-workers or what have you and

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.360
it's all about credentials right so the i

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.580
today you could like

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.080
you can literally assign you working on that

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.960
as well yeah so in fact we introduced

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:50.320
something

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.860
called agent 365 as a way to give

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.260
identities in fact extending the identities we have

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:56.880
for humans

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:59.720
today uh and the endpoint protection we have

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.340
for their compute devices to agents so you

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:02.860
might clone

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:05.260
me working in the hr department or working

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.500
in the marketing department and have a virtual

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:08.340
version of me

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.560
inside of office that's correct so so there

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:12.500
are two sort of modalities there one is

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.460
you give every

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.700
knowledge worker infinite minds that's kind of one

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:20.820
and then you create even infinite minds independent

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.220
of the your identity because the identity is

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:24.420
one of the key things you got to

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.040
get right even for it to

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.360
work right so for permissions and decision making

00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.660
permission decision making and like one of the

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:31.960
key

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.860
things is who did what to whom is

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:37.040
sort of the most important query in an

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.440
organization right at the end of

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.660
the day the organization needs to understand what

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.720
work got done and what's the provenance of

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.340
that work

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.400
and how do you trace it back right

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.220
so therefore you kind of want either what

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.480
if it's a human with a lot

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:55.020
of agents then it's really macro delegation micro

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.600
stating by the human whose identity was passed

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:57.820
on

00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:01.120
so it's delegation versus a separate identity and

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.540
that was done by a level of management

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:04.220
product

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:08.680
management that you've eliminated that alphabet's eliminated meta

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.500
has started to eliminate in their

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.180
organization four years ago you had the same

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:14.980
number of employees you have at microsoft now

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:16.420
but you put a

00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:18.900
90 billion dollars onto the top line of

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:21.000
the revenue in that time and you doubled

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.340
your income during that

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:26.040
time so how did that happen is that

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.500
automation of those jobs is that you were

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.380
a little bit over staffed

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.120
and i think it's it's actually you're pulling

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.140
on a very interesting thread which is at

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:35.580
some level

00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:38.580
what's the big structural change that needs to

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.520
happen in fact i would say this is

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.440
probably the

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.500
biggest change in knowledge work since pcs i

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.100
mean i always you know think about like

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.040
how did work happen

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.400
pre-pcs right i mean think about a

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.360
multinational company like ours trying to do a

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.120
forecast uh right

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.420
faxes went around inter-office memos got sent

00:08:57.420 --> 00:08:59.220
and then you kind of created a you

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.200
know a forecast

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.100
then suddenly you know pcs became standard issue

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.380
uh you put an excel spreadsheet put some

00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:05.760
numbers

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:07.760
sent it in email everybody entered numbers and

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.980
you had a forecast so the work the

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:11.580
work artifact and the

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:15.040
workflow all changed that's what's happening so for

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:18.060
example i'll give you uh at linkedin uh

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:19.020
we used to

00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:22.800
have product managers we had designers uh we

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.580
had front-end engineers and then we had

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:25.800
back-end engineers

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.820
and so on so what we did is

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:29.980
we sort of took those first four roles

00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:32.140
and combined them in fact increased

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:34.700
scope and said let's they're all full stack

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:37.600
builders so i like that because that's a

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.580
structural change

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:42.260
that allows for us to increase the change

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.360
both the work and the workflow between these

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.180
functions and i

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:47.820
would assume the velocity because you don't have

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:50.520
four people communicating and that throughput of ideas

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.600
it's just one person and vibe coding exactly

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.680
and there's a new workflow so at the

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.480
same time as you

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.500
can imagine if to build an ai product

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.920
today there's a complete new workflow right it

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:01.060
starts with evals

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:05.340
right so basically there's this eval to science

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:09.120
to infrastructure and so evals are done by

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:09.540
these full

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:11.660
stack builders and what have you and product

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:14.340
managers in the new form the infrastructure is

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:14.520
built

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.340
by the systems engineers at the back end

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.560
because they support the science that supports the

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.220
product so in

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:22.040
some sense there's a new loop uh and

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.620
you have to structurally change and so a

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:25.240
lot of what is

00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:29.140
happening inside of tech is that change uh

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:30.720
which is i think going to be pretty

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:32.140
massive uh and at the

00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:33.760
same time a company like ours i have

00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.540
to do everything it's not like i can

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:37.100
just so go live in the future i

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:39.100
have to make sure we're doing a fantastic

00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.740
job of doing hot patching on windows is

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:42.780
done with quality

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.580
while at the same time building the evals

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:47.620
that are improving co-pilot quality right and

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:48.300
so both of

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:50.540
those have to be first class i assume

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:52.420
this is the most challenging moment of your

00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:53.260
career because

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:57.440
microsoft was so dominant duopoly in some spaces

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.860
um but you really weren't up against the

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:01.480
competition

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.060
level you're up against now i was talking

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:05.760
to elon you know and he was sort

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.940
of saying well building

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:09.240
cars was pretty easy uh because i was

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.160
up against the legacy car makers and now

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.720
i'm up against just look

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.760
at the set you're up against yeah it's

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.700
a pretty intense time i mean so the

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.140
way i i always think

00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:23.200
is it's always helpful uh when you have

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:25.780
a complete new set of competitors every decade

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:26.380
because that

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.400
keeps you fit uh if you think about

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.380
it i joined uh microsoft in 92 when

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:33.080
i had novell as the big

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:37.280
existential competitor we had um uh and here

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.120
we are in 2026 uh and you're absolutely

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:40.620
right it's a

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:43.320
pretty intense time i'm glad there's the competition

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.540
it's it's quite honestly at the end of

00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:46.040
the day when

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.480
i look at it right as a percentage

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.100
of gdp five years from now where will

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.540
tech be right uh it will be higher

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:54.900
so we are blessed to be in this

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:58.660
industry it's a lot of intense competition but

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:00.420
it's not so zero sum

00:12:00.420 --> 00:12:02.220
as some people make it out high it's

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:04.400
getting much bigger much the tam and the

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.380
it's just the impact

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:06.820
of this tech is going to be so

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:09.900
massive um the question then of course is

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:11.440
what is like i i'm always

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.740
go back to what's the brand identity microsoft

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:16.720
has brand permission we have what do customers

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:17.240
expect

00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.620
from us it's sometimes we kind of overthink

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:23.260
somehow that every customer wants the same thing

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.580
from all of the competitors and finding that

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.380
out right it's kind of a different take

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:27.960
on the peter

00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.680
deal thing which is you've got to avoid

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:35.000
competition by really understanding what customers really want

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.220
from you uh versus thinking everybody's a competitor

00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:40.960
david yeah so there are a lot of

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:41.540
heads of state

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:44.100
here obviously at davos as well as ceos

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.360
of fortune 500 companies and i think you

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.060
got asked a question

00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:49.500
last night at the dinner about how they

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.700
should think about ai and how to be

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:53.600
successful and i recall

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.160
they used the word diffusion and i was

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.000
wondering if you could expand on those remarks

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:58.680
because that

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.580
really resonated with some of the policy work

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:02.500
i've been doing no absolutely in fact uh

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:03.160
what you all have

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.740
been doing to make sure in in this

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:08.800
context of the american tech stack um is

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.280
broadly used around the world

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.500
and is trusted around the world because i

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:16.300
think uh when i look back david to

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:19.040
me um uh at the end of the

00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:19.260
day

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:24.460
uh you create the technology but really the

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:29.280
benefits come only by intense use in fact

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.560
one of my favorite

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.520
studies has always been this work that uh

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:35.520
an economist i think or a dartman did

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.820
uh his name is diego

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:40.000
common where he studied uh basically what happened

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.280
during the industrial revolution um how did countries

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.020
get ahead um and the simple sort of

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:49.240
take away from that was any country uh

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:50.760
that brought the latest

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:54.900
technology into their uh country and then did

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:57.040
value add technology on top of it right

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:57.600
so it's like

00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.180
don't reinvent the wheel bring the latest and

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:02.500
then build on top of it that's to

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.160
me uh what happens you

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.860
know when you have diffusion so especially with

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:08.840
general purpose technology like ai it needs to

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:09.140
spread

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:10.720
like right in our you know in our

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.720
own country in the united states we now

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:14.520
need we have the tech the

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:16.240
question is is it being used in healthcare

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:19.180
is it being used um in financial services

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:20.080
is it being used

00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:22.140
in every sector of the economy by large

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.340
businesses small business public sector um so to

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:26.960
me under unless

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:29.840
and until we see that diffusion and intense

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:32.200
use uh we're not going to have the

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.740
success um uh and so that's

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:36.340
the phase we are in it's you know

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:38.940
it's diffusing faster um and so some of

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:40.200
the work policy work you

00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.220
have done um and in general all you

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.140
know the good news here is the technology

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:47.000
is there the rails around

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.860
cloud and mobile that were laid out make

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:51.800
it possible for this thing to spread right

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:52.720
it's not you know

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:55.140
impossible to get the tokens the question is

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:57.020
what are the use cases how do and

00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:58.120
how do you manage the

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:00.020
change in all of that um you know

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:01.640
like one of the questions at least in

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:02.960
davos is it's one thing for

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.040
the west and the developed nations what about

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.720
the global south um i think global south

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:08.240
has a huge

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.520
opportunity to quite frankly because to me like

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.120
let's say you know 40 50 of the

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.260
gdp of most global

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:18.780
south countries is public sector so just imagine

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:22.380
this tech making a difference in how the

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:22.840
governments

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.940
really parlay the taxpayer money into services for

00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:29.060
citizens and there's if there's efficiency gains

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:31.400
that's probably a couple of points of gdp

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:34.460
growth right there and so i'm very optimistic

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:35.220
that there's

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:37.360
going to be a poll uh and that

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.800
we should as the united states given the

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:41.260
technology stack we have

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.640
uh in europe in asia in you know

00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:47.420
in south america in africa and everywhere else

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:48.960
uh get it to be broadly

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.220
deployed one of the questions i get asked

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:54.200
a lot about the ai race is how

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.020
do you know if you're winning

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:57.480
or how do you know if the united

00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:00.540
states is ahead of its global competitors and

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:01.400
the answer i give is

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.480
market share you know if we look around

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.320
the world in five years and we see

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:08.200
that american companies

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.200
american technology has say 80 market share it

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.580
means we did a good job if we

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:13.260
look around the world in

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.460
five years and see that it's say chinese

00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:17.900
chips and chinese models that are being used

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:18.300
all over the

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:21.060
world well means we probably lost so you

00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:23.620
know ultimately usage is the proof of the

00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:25.120
pudding is in the

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.320
eating of it i mean the in this

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.540
case the way that you know that you're

00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:31.620
succeeding is through market

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:34.060
shares through usage i and i i would

00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:36.160
agree with that but david since you even

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:36.900
worked at microsoft

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:39.940
for a few years um you know one

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:41.660
of the things that i'm very grounded on

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.240
is always uh that bill

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.320
gates line of a platform right so one

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.800
of the things that i always think about

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.900
is it's market share but

00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:51.360
it's also ecosystem effects right see what the

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.160
united states always has done is not just

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:54.440
about

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:58.180
our market share or even um the revenues

00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:00.080
to u.s companies in fact one of

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.060
the things i learned at

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:03.340
microsoft is whenever i did a country visit

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:06.480
the data i would first study is in

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.980
let's say in the uk or in

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:09.720
switzerland or what have you is what is

00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:14.300
the total employment created in switzerland uh in

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:14.900
our channel

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:16.600
that used to be like the number one

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:19.420
thing uh in our country reports right and

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:20.680
the total number like the

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:24.100
number of it workers the number of office

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:27.600
workers channel so channel partners is isvs so

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:28.080
the number of

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:31.140
isvs uh who were there so we used

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.160
to have a complete marker of how did

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.380
the ecosystem around the platform

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:38.020
get built one country at a time and

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:40.080
that is what the united states has always

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.740
done in fact the u.s tech

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:46.440
stack including in china got built because others

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:49.340
built around our text the same thing is

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:49.560
going to

00:17:49.560 --> 00:17:50.960
happen so that's why i think the work

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:54.200
you're doing around diffusion right is about really

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:55.100
increasing

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:57.400
the size of the pie the trust in

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:00.320
the platform so that there is true economic

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:01.860
opportunity quite frankly

00:18:01.860 --> 00:18:04.300
well you're right and i remember actually you're

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.320
you brought back some memories from this is

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:06.600
about a

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:08.920
decade ago when my company yamra was acquired

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:11.420
by microsoft we were part of uh the

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:12.220
sharepoint group and

00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:15.200
i remember that the um the product managers

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:16.860
there were very proud of the fact that

00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:19.200
the revenue from the

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:24.080
sharepoint ecosystem meaning non-microsoft the um the

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:26.740
consulting community the implementers who would

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:28.880
go into companies implement sharepoint i think their

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.500
revenue is something like seven times greater than

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.580
microsoft's own software revenue and i think in

00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:37.320
aggregate and i think and i think bill

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:37.920
had a line

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.160
about you're not an ecosystem or a platform

00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:43.080
until the revenue on top of your platform

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.820
is some you know

00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:46.920
factor of your own revenue that's right and

00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.600
and i and i think that i think

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:49.280
what's really important

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.540
about this is when we talk about diffusion

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:54.020
and obviously want the united states to have

00:18:54.020 --> 00:18:54.940
this leading

00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:57.100
position it doesn't mean it's bad for the

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:58.820
rest of the world because they're able to

00:18:58.820 --> 00:18:59.760
build on top of

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.660
those platforms and create even more value 100

00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:04.820
in fact that's sort of the most important

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:05.440
point right

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:07.020
so this is not that this is not

00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:11.160
about american tech um and american revenues to

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.060
the united states it's

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:15.420
actually creating opportunity using a new platform everywhere

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.620
and in fact you know you know like

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:18.040
i

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:20.560
remember i worked on our database products uh

00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.100
in the 90s uh you know with sap

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:24.420
in fact the combination

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:28.940
of uh sql server and r3 were successful

00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:30.700
on both sides there's a lot talked about

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:31.720
intel and microsoft

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.620
but one of the other things that i

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:34.960
grew up in which has sort of been

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.620
foundational in how i look at the

00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:39.080
world is what we did with a european

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.080
software company that is still uh you know

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:42.280
a giant and so

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:43.960
that you know who knows what the next

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:46.360
big ai app will be and where and

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.720
what will happen but uh i i sort

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:50.880
of go in with the attitude that there

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:53.740
will be tech companies uh maybe even top

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:55.300
five tech companies that

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:58.100
could emerge everywhere with even the american tech

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:02.140
stack you have um done some amazing acquisitions

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:02.300
and

00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:03.700
you're quite a deal maker on top of

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:05.860
being a technologist it's probably the least reported

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:09.900
aspect of your spectacular tenure and the massive

00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:13.760
growth you've had but you did a deal

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:14.700
with open ai

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:18.300
and probably one of the most savvy slash

00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:20.620
controversial deal makers of all time sam altman

00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:22.400
that deal was

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:26.940
looked at as you you you're you're set

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:28.460
up to get a windfall in cash which

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:29.700
you don't need as microsoft

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:32.020
always nice i'm guess guessing if they ipo

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:34.680
but did you create potentially and this was

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:35.540
the criticism of

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:40.320
it an ultimate competitor to microsoft and how

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.140
do you think about that and how can

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:43.160
microsoft which

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:46.020
missed steve bomber's biggest regret missing the mobile

00:20:46.020 --> 00:20:49.940
revolution how can you not have a gemini

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:53.200
an xai a claude that is your own

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:55.620
or in your mind do you have that

00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:57.160
because you have the source code of open

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.740
ai yeah i think that that's right so

00:20:58.740 --> 00:21:00.700
when when people say uh where is your

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:01.760
foundation model i mean

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:02.720
at the end of the day we do

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.020
have the ip but that said i think

00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:06.380
you bring up a couple different things

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:09.140
right one is to us the most important

00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:11.680
thing when i look at what is microsoft's

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:14.100
strategy today one is

00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:16.480
we want to build token factories right so

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:18.920
our biggest business today is azure business and

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:19.740
the azure business

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:22.040
the tam given what's going to happen is

00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.900
is so huge that we now need to

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:25.860
be fantastic uh at building

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:28.420
these token factories and um that means a

00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:31.600
heterogeneous fleet of infrastructure and that

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.860
every hyperscaler is always done which is use

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:36.640
software to make maximum use of it and

00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:37.600
for tco and

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.200
utilization so that's one side of it then

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.140
there's the app server business right which is

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:42.820
everybody

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:44.700
we you talked about like if everyone's going

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:47.140
to be building agents have infinite minds have

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:48.000
these rl

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.660
gems have evals what have you there's an

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:52.560
entire just like every platform has had an

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:53.060
app server

00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:55.160
server this one has an app server that's

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:57.000
what we're doing with foundry and what have

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:57.240
you right

00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:59.500
so there's an app server business in that

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:02.220
app server one of the things that structurally

00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:02.900
now is pretty

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:06.360
clear is anyone building any application or any

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:08.620
company is going to use not one model

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:09.300
but all the

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:11.260
models right why would i not right which

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:14.220
is in fact i will orchestrate for any

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:15.840
given task even multiple

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:18.400
models right there's this one nice thing that

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.340
we came out in our healthcare practice called

00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:21.020
the decision

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:24.880
orchestrator what it proves is that by assigning

00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:28.820
roles right so investigator data analyst domain

00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:32.520
expert just giving even prompted roles to models

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:36.140
and then orchestrating them gets better results than

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:38.560
any one single frontier model am i right

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.380
to read into that then that you're bullish

00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:42.280
on the open source

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.900
models and think large language models will largely

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:47.300
be commoditized and that's not where the value

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:47.520
will

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:48.900
accrue in fact the way i think about

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:51.280
it is that just like what happened apple

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.260
thinks that too by

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:54.280
the way what the way you think about

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.280
what happened in the database market right you

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:57.480
know i used to be

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.740
like everything is just a sql database until

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:01.500
it was not right there was i mean

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:02.040
think about it there

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:05.400
dock databases there is no sql databases the

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:08.480
proliferation of database right who would have thought

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.820
that the database market would have such a

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:12.760
richness to it or that it could ever

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:14.060
be open source that was

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:16.040
that's my i mean talk about postgres or

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:17.580
what has happened even with mongo which is

00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:18.360
open but there

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:19.940
are even companies that have backed it and

00:23:19.940 --> 00:23:21.820
so so to me that's what's going to

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:23.420
happen and to me a model

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:25.940
is like the database market you know it's

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:27.920
got it's gone differences but i sort of

00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:28.940
somehow think that

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:31.400
it's not they're definitely going to be frontier

00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.520
models that are close source you know they're

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:33.600
going

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.000
to be open source models that are going

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.980
to be uh uh frontier class in fact

00:23:37.980 --> 00:23:39.560
if anything i think in this

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:42.340
next year what will be probably a big

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:45.660
part of the discussion is what's the future

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:47.880
of a firm a firm

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.620
should be able to take the tacit knowledge

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:56.400
it has and embed it inside awaits in

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:57.460
a model that they

00:23:57.460 --> 00:23:59.900
control right so when somebody asked me how

00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:01.560
many models should be there i'll say as

00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:02.400
many models as

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.400
firms in the world right that's sort of

00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:07.640
the extreme way uh because because to me

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:08.920
that's how i think

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:12.380
this this knowledge economy becomes an ai economy

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:14.840
are you secretly and you can say it

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:15.140
here since

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:18.300
we're on all in working on an llm

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:21.580
to exist on the windows desktop because that

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:22.860
you are you have it like

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:25.560
today there's a phi silica model which is

00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:29.460
completely resident using npus and of course using

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:30.580
uh gpus in

00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:34.120
fact the largest installation um of high power

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:35.460
in fact it's one of the fascinating the

00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:36.180
workstation is

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:37.540
back i'm one of the most if you

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:40.420
went to cus great it's so microsoft because

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:41.620
yeah you have a nice

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:44.400
desktop business oh absolutely and so we and

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.120
in fact we think that that form factor

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.460
especially i mean

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.560
i i always say this which is uh

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:52.080
you know i started my career on a

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:53.980
command line who knows i may just end

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:55.480
it in a command line but you started

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:57.780
at sun which was the original five ten

00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:59.080
thousand dollar workstation do

00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:01.240
you see a time where you'll be meeting

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:03.560
with your customers here and advocating a ten

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:04.240
twenty thousand

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:07.320
dollar desktop machine that has an llm and

00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:10.140
the hardware you can put a dgx card

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:11.440
and you can have

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:14.100
like just a fantastic machine and the models

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:15.600
i and by the way you know we

00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.460
are one architecture tweak away

00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:20.140
from even having some kind of a distributed

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:23.100
model architecture right even an moe architecture that

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:26.360
shows knows how to really distribute itself right

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:29.160
that's the type of breakthrough that can completely

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:32.260
change uh what hybrid ai may look like

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:35.460
but we're absolutely committed and focused on making

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:36.240
the pc

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:39.480
a great place for local models uh and

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:41.680
local models that then do even a lot

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.120
of the prompt processing and

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.760
call into the cloud right so there's a

00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:46.240
whole lot of work that can happen and

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:47.060
that's sort of definitely

00:25:47.060 --> 00:25:49.020
something that's in that way yeah i think

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:51.040
that the clog co-work has kind of

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.100
shown the power of tapping

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:53.620
into the local file drive and be able

00:25:53.620 --> 00:25:55.780
to use that that that brings up another

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:56.540
point you you got me

00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:58.500
thinking about yammer and for people don't know

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:00.540
um you know yammer's claim to fame this

00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:01.280
is about 15

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.380
years ago was that it pioneered a lot

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:05.140
of um well it used a lot of

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:06.880
consumer growth tactics to attack

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:09.500
enterprise software i'm wondering as you think about

00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:13.500
enterprise adoption of ai how do you think

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:13.940
it's

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:15.620
going to spread over the next year it

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:17.360
feels like we're at sort of a a

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:19.660
a critical point do you think it's

00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:21.040
going to be top down is it going

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.080
to come from the ceo directing a team

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:24.520
giving them a strategic

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:27.120
transformation project or they're going to do an

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:29.400
rfp or do you think it's going to

00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:30.520
spread bottom up

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:33.600
in the enterprise through ai native employees who

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:36.320
are adaptable who are using the tools in

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:36.580
their own

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:38.700
lives and they start to bring these things

00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:41.960
to work and start accomplishing amazing things yeah

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:42.280
no i

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:44.120
think you know like all things david i

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:45.760
think it's both the top down bottom up

00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:47.540
right uh the the reason i

00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:49.580
say that uh top down is if i

00:26:49.580 --> 00:26:52.620
look at the roi uh of uh applying

00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:55.440
ai and customer service uh or in supply

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.560
chain or in hr self-service those are

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:03.320
the easy projects where uh it and cxos

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:04.600
can make calls and

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:06.980
that's where you're seeing the first drop of

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:10.140
uh real ai adoption but the bottom up

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:11.660
is what ultimately

00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:13.800
will happen right i mean even with the

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.760
pcs in fact if you think back at

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:17.500
it the lawyers brought word in

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:20.240
and then finance bought excel in and then

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:22.360
email came and then it became standard issue

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:23.440
that's what's

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:26.240
happening right now so for example these agents

00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:28.460
when i sort of talk about everybody's building

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:28.980
agents

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:32.460
they're figuring out a way to go create

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:36.100
these things that are changing workflow and removing

00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:36.640
drudgery

00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:38.980
in their work right that's sort of the

00:27:38.980 --> 00:27:42.100
beginning of what is a bottom-up transformation

00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:43.760
um you didn't

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.880
i was in fact the thing that i'm

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.920
most excited about is this bottom-up change

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:48.860
even at microsoft for

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:52.520
example we manage something like 500 odd fiber

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:55.240
operators around the world in in azure today

00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:55.860
and

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:57.440
by the way i had not myself realized

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:58.600
it a lot of it you know it's

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:00.740
called devops but it's a it's a physical

00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:03.580
asset things get cut and when you sort

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:05.540
of say devops that means you literally are

00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:06.580
emailing people and

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:08.180
saying hey what happened to that fiber cut

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:09.560
how do we repair it so there's a

00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:11.000
lot of back and forth

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.880
so this network the person who runs our

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:16.680
global network basically has built to your point

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:16.900
about

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:20.300
these personas they're just digital employees essentially that

00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:22.700
are doing all of that devops

00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:26.080
and so that's and those are completely bottoms

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:28.480
up uh where you see the tools it's

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:29.060
kind of like hey i

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:31.320
have the new way to build agents it's

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.580
there i'm going to use it to create

00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:34.720
levels of automation

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:39.100
that remove drudgery improve efficiency improve quality and

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:41.560
that ultimately is a skilling thing

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.420
which is sort of the big issue which

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:46.000
is uh and skilling is not mystical it's

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.040
just by doing right

00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:48.240
so it's not like i go to a

00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.520
class per se it's like the diffusion of

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:53.500
the tools uh and using the tools and

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:55.440
that i think is what's really going to

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.280
be happening and we're in a very interesting

00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:59.960
moment empowering an

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:03.220
existing employee with these tools is so much

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:06.320
easier than hiring and mentoring and bringing up

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.060
the next generation so it feels like we're

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:09.820
in a little bit of an indigestion moment

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:13.160
at microsoft do you think who's going to

00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:16.020
have my job in 30 or 40 years

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:18.200
if the company stays the same

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:23.020
size because given your technology first approach there's

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:25.100
really no reason to ever add another microsoft

00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:27.800
employee at the pace this is going and

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:31.180
you haven't for four years so how you

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:31.860
may have swapped some

00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:33.540
in and out and changed the texture of

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:36.180
it so how do you think about maybe

00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:37.820
this next generation what

00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:39.780
advice would you have for these college graduates

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:41.700
who maybe don't have an offer for microsoft

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:41.940
right

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:43.260
now and you used to spend a lot

00:29:43.260 --> 00:29:45.840
of time on that building that group but

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:46.840
maybe you don't have that

00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:49.020
luxury now do you think about it ever

00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:51.120
i mean it's a great question i you

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:52.260
know there's a little bit of a

00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:54.640
debate what happens to early in korea and

00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.620
how is college recruiting i still am a

00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:57.660
big believer in

00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:59.440
college recruiting because at the end of the

00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:03.960
day um this is going to change the

00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:06.120
curve by which anyone

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:08.720
can pick up proficiency in a code base

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:10.640
let's just it takes sort of just regular

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:13.020
cs hiring uh what has

00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:16.120
changed is perhaps for someone who comes in

00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:19.200
new into a team and to be able

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.180
to ramp up thanks to

00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:26.020
all of uh the markdowns the skills uh

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:27.920
the fact that i can go ask the

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:29.140
agent let me think about it

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:32.940
right it's like having an unbelievable mentor who's

00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:35.520
getting you onboarded onto a code base faster

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:36.080
so in

00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:39.360
some sense the productivity curve uh of a

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:42.100
college hire is going to be much steeper

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:43.060
than it ever before

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:45.320
so i think there might be a difference

00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:46.840
in fact one of the things we're experimenting

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:47.540
with is a different

00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:50.060
type of apprenticeship right which is you take

00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:53.720
somebody who's an ic senior dev have like

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:54.400
a cohort

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:58.020
of college uh hires working with them because

00:30:58.020 --> 00:30:59.740
it's a new way of working it's like

00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:00.600
i remember like all

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:02.240
you know everybody who joined microsoft would say

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:04.480
go how did uh you know whatever um

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:05.980
cutler implement

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:07.940
malloc or what have you right he would

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:10.500
go try to read uh his code to

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:12.280
understand uh what great

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:15.440
craftsmanship looks like nowadays i think that great

00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:18.540
craftsmanship uh comes by looking at even how

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:23.420
the 10x 100x engineers use ai to build

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:26.520
great quality products uh and that is what

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:27.580
these new college

00:31:27.580 --> 00:31:30.140
guys will learn and learn faster and so

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:32.020
that's a beneficial thing for a company like

00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:32.680
us because at

00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:34.120
the end of the day you know until

00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:37.500
we saw longevity or something we need people

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:38.900
to come into the workforce

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:40.840
be successful at microsoft so we are very

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:43.400
committed but we are also making sure that

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:44.340
the scopes of the

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:47.700
jobs make sense for what the aspirations of

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:49.080
people are going to be both who are

00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:50.100
currently in the workforce

00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:52.860
and people who are entering the workforce okay

00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:55.900
on that note satya nadella thank you so

00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:56.160
much
