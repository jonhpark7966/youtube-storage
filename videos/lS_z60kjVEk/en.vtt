00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.340
NEO can now turn any prompt into autonomous

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.980
action. With the latest update to the 1X

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.740
World Model, NEO learns from internet-scale data

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.440
and applies it to the real world.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.760
By visualizing future actions with a video model

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.780
grounded in physics, NEO can generalize to new

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.700
tasks it's never seen before. This opens a

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.640
new path for robotics learning, one where robots

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.280
learn by teaching themselves, using the data they

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.740
generated on their own, and grow in AI

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.880
capabilities alongside the rapidly improving video models.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.080
Our world model is pre-trained on web

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.480
-scale video data that captures human interaction, and

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.860
then post-trained on robot data to ground

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.000
that understanding in real-world physics and NEO's

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.580
humanoid embodiment. This allows NEO to visualize future

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.320
actions and use a built-in inverse dynamics

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.480
model to turn those visualizations into movement.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.040
Today, we'll use the world model as NEO's

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.760
cognitive core to execute autonomous action sequences several

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.400
seconds long.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.720
How it works is you'll give NEO a

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.480
prompt with voice or text. For this example,

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.420
I'll use the world model desktop interface to

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.880
illustrate how it comes together. And start with

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.480
something simple, like having NEO pack this orange

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.700
into the lunchbox.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.760
Once you prompt NEO, it'll take what it

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.600
sees as input to generate a visualization of

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.480
how to complete the request. As you can

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.000
see on the screen below, NEO is visualizing

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.280
how to perform this task using its world

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.580
model.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.880
You can either have NEO automatically execute the

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.180
generation or choose the best one to run

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.400
from among several parallel generations.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.000
While NEO has never seen these objects before,

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.440
there are still some examples of pick and

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.200
place tasks in our dataset. So one might

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.440
assume it's generalizing to a similar task to

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.480
create this visualization.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.240
But this is not the case. With the

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.140
world model, NEO can perform any task with

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.040
any object, whether there is existing data or

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.280
not.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.560
Not only has NEO never seen this toilet,

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.660
but it has never performed a task anywhere

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.480
near similar. Without any prior data on how

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.860
to operate a toilet seat, the transfer of

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.020
human knowledge becomes a lot more apparent.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.000
The world model is also really useful for

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.700
handling unpredictable environments.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.720
Traditional AI models for robots are often overly

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.680
sensitive to the surroundings, like changes in lighting

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.060
or even random objects in the environment.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.560
NEO's world model, by contrast, applies human knowledge

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.580
of how to navigate highly dynamic settings to

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.100
handle even the most extreme changes in environment.

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.200
Given a world model can generate just about

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.740
anything you can imagine, there is no limit

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.520
to what NEO can try and execute autonomously.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:36.120
While NEO's world model is trusted, they are

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.700
consistentlyendre learning and successful watches in activity momento

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:37.740
inbetween.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.940
We still have work to do to increase

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.040
the length and success rate of each generated

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.500
ability

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.960
to make the world model more useful.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.840
But with the world model, NEO can create

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.940
unlimited data of itself doing real-world tasks,

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.620
creating a flywheel that enables NEO to teach

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.980
itself anything, marking a true paradigm shift in

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.600
AI and robotics.
