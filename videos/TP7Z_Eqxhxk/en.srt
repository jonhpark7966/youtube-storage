1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,480
You would prefer the human race to endure,

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:07,820
right? You're hesitating. Yes? I don't know. I

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,700
would’ This is Peter Thiel. This is a

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,860
long hesitation. There's so many questions. Should the

5
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:22,140
human race survive? Yes. He's been a major

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,800
player in Silicon Valley for a long, long

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,440
time. I'm Peter Thiel. I build companies and

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,920
I support people who are building

9
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,260
new things from social networks to rocket ships.

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,420
You might know him as the multi-billionaire

11
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:35,600
who

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,060
co-founded PayPal and Palantir. As Facebook's first

13
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,540
outside investor. The guy who funds out their

14
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,060
projects

15
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:45,100
like floating countries, private space travel and the

16
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,720
quest for immortality. Peter Thiel rejects the idea

17
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:51,720
that death is inevitable. He wants to transform

18
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:56,360
humanity. Transhumanism was this radical transformation

19
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,920
where your human natural body where your human

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,700
natural body gets transformed into an immortal body.

21
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,500
We want you to be able to change

22
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,660
your heart and change your mind and change

23
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,440
your whole body.

24
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,460
But he also wants to change something else.

25
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,840
For decades, Thiel has schemed from the shadows

26
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,220
to reshape American politics.

27
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:21,540
Tonight, I urge all of my fellow Americans

28
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,360
to stand up and vote for Donald Trump.

29
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,360
He bankrolled Trump's first campaign. He turbocharged J

30
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:31,500
.D. Vance's career. Thiel openly questions the

31
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,480
democratic system. And he's declared that to him,

32
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,000
freedom is incompatible with democracy.

33
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,020
His vision of an ideal society sounds more

34
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,400
like an oligarchy. A country ruled by a

35
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,640
few powerful rich

36
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,220
people. Or even just one. Today, his influence

37
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,200
is rapidly expanding across the world. From the

38
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,760
beginning of

39
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,320
his career, he's been building tools to rewire

40
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,020
how power works. Palantir, his brainchild, enables intelligence

41
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,560
agencies and militaries to anticipate their enemy's next

42
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,060
move before it's made. Maybe even your next

43
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:07,720
move, too.

44
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,520
None of this happened by accident. Peter Thiel

45
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,520
plays the long game. He's patiently planned his

46
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,100
moves for

47
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,620
decades, always several steps ahead. So what does

48
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,140
Peter Thiel actually want?

49
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,300
What's his problem with democracy? And is there

50
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,080
an endgame?

51
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,920
This video is largely based on the research

52
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,600
collected in The Contrarian, Peter Thiel and

53
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,420
Silicon Valley's Pursuit of Power by Max Chavkin.

00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,200
You'll find a link in the description.

55
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,900
New York City, 2010. A TV show has

56
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,440
set up a night for Peter Thiel to

57
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,640
meet Gary Kasparov,

58
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,680
one of the greatest chess players of all

59
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,460
time. Thiel and Kasparov have met before and

60
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,260
get along well.

61
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,580
They like chatting about politics, technology, and of

62
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,640
course, chess. Peter Thiel's a diehard chess fan.

63
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,680
In fact, he's a national chess master. He's

64
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,120
admired the grandmaster Kasparov since he was a

65
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,620
teenager.

66
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:15,660
And the respect is mutual. Kasparov admires Thiel's

67
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,340
intelligence and business sense.

68
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,860
He is one of the probably most successful

69
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,440
entrepreneurs of his generation. He is very

70
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,760
aggressively investing. He looks for the future. Thiel's

71
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,980
legendary status in business is hard to

72
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,280
overstate. His companies have created technologies that have

73
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,180
changed the course of the modern world.

74
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,600
And his influence helped define tech, an industry

75
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,160
that has produced millions of jobs and trillions

76
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,000
of dollars of wealth. That night, Kasparov and

77
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,360
Thiel hit up a chess club. Thiel plays

78
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:44,800
a game of

79
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,680
speed chess with the owner and wins. I'm

80
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,720
totally embarrassed.

81
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,120
Embarrassed as well. Kasparov suggests his chess skills

82
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,220
are probably why Thiel's such a successful

83
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,040
businessman and why he tends to hire chess

84
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,460
players for his companies. That's why he's hiring

85
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:01,760
chess

86
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,400
players, you know. Peter just told me the

87
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,120
story that one day he's the IPO for

88
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,620
Paypal. So he did a

89
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,460
simul for ten employees of Paypal. And sure,

90
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,080
Thiel is probably onto something. Chess skills transfer

91
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,600
well into the world of business. It's a

92
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,920
game of strategy, where it pays off to

93
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,080
think several moves

94
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,520
ahead. Skills that don't hurt in politics either.

95
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,640
Sometime after this evening, Kasparov and Thiel drift

96
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,000
apart.

97
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,180
Maybe the two don't have that much in

98
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,500
common after all. It's not just that the

99
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,820
Russian Kasparov is a

100
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:36,140
way better chess player. He's also one of

101
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,840
the world's most prominent pro-democracy activists.

102
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:42,520
He's a major thorn in Putin's sight, tirelessly

103
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,260
campaigning for a freer Russia.

104
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,580
So I'm fighting to restore democracy in my

105
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:47,920
country.

106
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,240
Trump's potential victory could threaten not only democracy

107
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,860
in this country, but you know,

108
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:58,080
democracy worldwide. And Peter Thiel? Well, kind of

109
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,300
the opposite trajectory.

110
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,720
Critics warn he's emerging as a major threat

111
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,360
to American democracy.

112
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,200
Billionaires like Thiel reshaping politics is terrifying. Connecting

113
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,700
to airport Wi-Fi ranks way

114
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,760
lower on the scale. But having your data

115
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,360
floating around unprotected online is a threat you

116
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:16,940
can actually

117
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,080
do something about. This is where today's sponsor

did you actually just scan that QR code?

137
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,060
Peter Thiel is around 8 years old when

138
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,940
his family arrives in Swakopmund, a former German

139
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,620
colony on

140
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,220
Namibia's coast. He moved here with his parents

141
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,020
and brother after some years in Ohio. During

142
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,040
the 1970s,

143
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,740
the city is occupied by apartheid South Africa.

144
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,980
At the time, it's a town clinging to

145
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,920
its German roots,

146
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,820
where Hitler's birthday is still celebrated and the

147
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,240
Nazi salute is a casual greeting for some.

148
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,540
Peter's father, Klaus, takes an engineering job at

149
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:34,380
a uranium mine just outside town. The mine

150
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:34,520
is

151
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,300
controversial and shrouded in secrecy. According to international

152
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,560
law, South Africa isn't allowed to

153
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,060
mine here, but they go ahead anyway. Extracting

154
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,420
Namibia's uranium is part of South Africa's

155
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,960
nuclear weapons program. The regime is secretly developing

156
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,860
bombs to defend against a possible

157
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,800
Soviet attack and to protect the apartheid way

158
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,700
of life. According to a former British activist

159
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,100
group,

160
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,080
black laborers have worked at the mine under

161
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,900
dangerous conditions. Meanwhile, white families

162
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,960
like the Thiels enjoy a privileged life. Brand

163
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,860
new medical facilities, country club memberships,

164
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:11,780
kids in private school. Young Peter is reportedly

165
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,600
first put in a whites-only school in

166
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,260
Johannesburg,

167
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,680
then in a German language school in Swakopmund,

168
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,440
where their curriculum pushes a Christian nationalist

169
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,180
worldview and even paints white South Africans as

170
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:25,120
the real victims of the region. This is

171
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,280
where

172
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,480
Peter Thiel spends formative years. It's a world

173
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,160
where his family benefits from a white supremacist

174
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:31,540
regime,

175
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,460
where his father actively advances its military interests.

176
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,260
A world where the founding belief is that

177
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:38,520
some

178
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,160
people are meant to rule, and the majority

179
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,240
must serve.

180
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,780
When Peter is 10, he and his family

181
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,340
return to the US. Peter is developing into

182
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,720
a classic nerd. He loves

183
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,980
sci-fi and fantasy, especially Lord of the

184
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,260
Rings. He's top of the class and becomes

185
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,000
one of the country's

186
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,920
top chess players under the age of 13.

187
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,900
It's not cool to be a nerd in

188
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,420
the 70s and 80s, so Peter is reportedly

189
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:09,320
bullied on the regular. But he knows he's

190
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,580
smart and going places. His chessboard has a

191
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,640
sticker that says

192
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,460
born to win. Peter wants the best for

193
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,380
himself, so he studies hard to get into

194
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,360
the top university.

195
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,920
At the time, Stanford is ranked number one

196
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,920
in the US. When he makes it there

197
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,220
in 1985, Stanford's a huge

198
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:30,140
letdown. Peter expects fellow overachievers, but finds a

199
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,540
party scene instead. He'd rather hit the

200
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,820
books than the bong. And he's once again

201
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,620
teased for being a nerd. According to the

202
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,620
author Max Chafkin,

203
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,880
many of the students he perceived as bullies

204
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,460
also identify as liberals. A connection that reportedly

205
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,860
sticks with him. We in fact asked Thiel

206
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,000
ourselves, but didn't get a response. Peter developed

207
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,380
into a

208
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:53,860
Reagan-supporting conservative. The campus itself feels far

209
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,180
too left-wing for him. Anti-Reagan and

210
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:59,480
anti-Apartheid protests are prominent. And Peter starts

211
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,340
to clash with demonstrators. In The Contrarian,

212
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,920
Chafkin describes how classmates recall at least one

213
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,340
instance where Peter defended Apartheid as

214
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,520
economically sound. An allegation that Thiel has since

215
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:15,660
denied. At the time, some defenders of Apartheid

216
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,180
drew on libertarian arguments. Libertarians believe the best

217
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,000
society maximizes personal

218
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,860
and economic freedom while minimizing government control. They

219
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,100
see free, unregulated markets as the

220
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,960
best way to allocate resources and drive innovation.

221
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:33,380
More radical libertarians value property rights and

222
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:37,060
free markets above basically anything else. Critics say

223
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:39,240
this leaves little room for values like social

224
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,880
justice, which are cast as secondary or even

225
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,800
incompatible with the libertarian definition of freedom.

226
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,900
From that perspective, Apartheid could be rationalized. South

227
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,380
Africa's systematic denial

228
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,480
of civil rights was simply the price to

229
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,460
pay for its higher level of wealth than

230
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,420
neighboring countries.

231
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,460
By Peter's sophomore year, he's known on campus

232
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:01,200
as a hardcore libertarian. And though the 80s

233
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:01,360
see

234
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,340
students increasingly advocate for race and gender equality,

235
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,440
Stanford is not an entirely liberal

236
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,900
institution. It has a fair share of other

237
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,680
conservative and libertarian students and faculty members

238
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,200
during Peter's time there. Still, Shevkin describes Peter

239
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,500
feeling like he's in the minority and that

240
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,180
the dominant campus culture is hostile to people

241
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,720
like him. So he does what he'll keep

242
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,400
doing throughout

243
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,080
his life. He builds a network of like

244
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,700
-minded men. The beginnings of a network that

245
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,500
will support him

246
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,200
throughout his career. What will later be known

247
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,160
as the so-called PayPal Mafia.

248
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,600
With 11 other conservative men, Peter launches a

249
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,860
campus newspaper. The Stanford Review aims to stir

250
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:45,320
things up. It regularly criticizes campus culture from

251
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,680
a conservative perspective, with a famously

252
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,820
biting style. Throughout Peter's time at Stanford, a

253
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:54,020
few pieces especially stirred a pot. Shevkin found

254
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,140
a

255
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,140
few examples in the Stanford archives that he

256
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:59,180
wasn't allowed to reproduce. One columnist claimed that

257
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:03,100
gay men engage in unnatural sex. Another complained

258
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,660
when Stanford considered adding non-white authors to

259
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:08,320
the Western culture course, arguing it signaled the

260
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,080
decline of the West. One whole issue was

261
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:11,700
devoted to

262
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,680
passionately defending a student accused of statutory rape,

263
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:17,800
who was later found guilty. Peter's not just

264
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,960
looking to provoke. He wants money, power, and

265
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,660
influence. And as its founding editor-in-chief,

266
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,120
the Stanford Review launches him into the public

267
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,760
intellectual he's known as today.

268
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,700
The paper captures the attention of high-profile

269
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,860
conservatives, and a bit later Peter gets a

270
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,060
book

271
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,160
deal. The diversity myth is co-authored with

272
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,400
David Sachs, the student who wrote in defense

273
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,480
of an accused racist in the Stanford Review.

274
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,680
Nowadays, Sachs is also an influential figure on

275
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,080
the American right. He currently serves the Trump

276
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,460
administration as the White House's AI and

277
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:51,740
Crypto Czar. The book argues that universities are

278
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,740
dangerous breeding grounds for left-wing

279
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:58,460
intellectual conformity. That nowadays, real racism barely exists

280
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,520
in America. And that diversity

281
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,220
initiatives pose a threat to Western culture. Sachs

282
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,140
and Teal have since apologized for some of

283
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:06,400
the more

284
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,780
controversial parts of the book. But these are

285
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,960
the same anti-woke sentiments that are winning

286
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,520
elections

287
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:23,620
today. Though Peter has plenty of gripes about

288
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:26,000
Stanford, he stays on and graduates from its

289
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,640
law school in 1992. He moves to New

290
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,500
York to begin his legal career. Only aiming

291
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,700
for the best, his goal

292
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,140
is to clerk for the Supreme Court. He's

293
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:37,700
got top grades, his own influential paper, and

294
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,540
connections to the

295
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,680
right people. But it's not enough. I got

296
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,340
interviews with two justices. They normally interview eight

297
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,660
people and select four as clerks. And I

298
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,800
missed it with both. And it felt like

299
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,960
it was the absolute end

300
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:53,620
of the world. Peter's not used to setbacks.

301
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,280
He plunges into what he later described as

302
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:56,920
a quarter-life

303
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,320
crisis and briefly moves back in with his

304
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:02,420
parents. But back on the West Coast, Peter

305
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,680
proves he has a neck

306
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,500
for turning losses into big wins.

307
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:14,020
It's 1996. The tech industry is booming. Silicon

308
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:16,220
Valley is a place with endless possibilities,

309
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,320
loads of investor money, and above all, unclear

310
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,440
rules. Peter wants in. Sure, he can't really

311
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:22,760
code,

312
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,220
but he can hand that off on someone

313
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,980
else. Peter studies up on hedge fund management,

314
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:27,740
raises some

315
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,940
capital and reinvents himself as an investor. At

316
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,520
the same time, he continues publishing anti-woke

317
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:33,960
columns.

318
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,920
One that claims indigenous people stay as anti

319
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,000
-western winds up in the Wall Street Journal.

320
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:42,420
By chance, Peter meets the brilliant young cryptographer

321
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,960
Max Leftchin. Max is obsessed with

322
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,560
Palm Pilots, clunky little handheld computers. At the

323
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,520
time, they're barely more than a calendar with

324
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:50,640
an

325
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,600
internet connection. Not all investors would listen to

326
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,980
a 20-something jabber away about Palm Pilots.

327
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:59,180
But Peter is not a typical investor. Max

328
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,460
believes Palm Pilots will have way more potential

329
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:01,900
if they

330
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,940
can be linked to businesses. If personal devices

331
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,720
were linked to a business's infrastructure,

332
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,240
a whole new world of users would open

333
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,680
up. Like connecting an individual directly with a

334
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,080
bank.

335
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,500
All someone needs to figure out is how

336
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,860
to build an encrypted network that can securely

337
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,360
link a

338
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:21,280
handheld device with a corporate system. And Max

339
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,800
believes he can do it. He is way

340
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,680
ahead of his time,

341
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,940
and Peter sees the potential immediately. He offers

342
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,660
Max a quarter million dollar investment

343
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,200
the very next day. Peter will become known

344
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,740
for these big bets on inexperienced founders.

345
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,900
Bets that very often pay off.

346
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,240
On the surface, PayPal looks just like another

347
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,700
convenient way to pay. But in reality,

348
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,380
it was built on a radically libertarian vision.

349
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,980
Money moving freely, beyond government control.

350
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,520
The same vision that would later drive the

351
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,060
crypto movement. And just like crypto,

352
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,700
that freedom quickly attracts the grey areas of

353
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,280
the economy.

354
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,640
PayPal's early growth comes from industries most banks

355
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,480
avoided, like gambling and NSFW stuff.

356
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,840
Good thing Peter's been nurturing his political connections.

357
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,340
As Chafkin tells it,

358
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,440
Thiel worked to keep his business alive by

359
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,360
lobbying congress to keep online gambling legal and

360
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:15,800
to stop

361
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,140
PayPal from being treated as a national bank.

362
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,620
We also asked Peter Thiel directly about this,

363
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,100
but didn't get a response either.

364
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,480
Ecommerce is exploding in popularity. There's high demand

365
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,360
for a tool that can simplify online

366
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,000
transaction. And Max and Peter aren't the only

367
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,520
ones working on a solution. PayPal isn't even

368
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:34,960
the only

369
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:37,740
online payment startup in the same building. There's

370
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,420
a very similar company on the same floor.

371
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,480
It's called

372
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,680
x.com and its founder has a lot

373
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,440
in common with Peter. Most notably, Elon Musk

374
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,640
is also an enterprising

375
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,780
immigrant with roots in South Africa. Like Peter,

376
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,380
he also shows little regard for traditional rules

377
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:53,580
of

378
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,380
the banking industry. Playing by every rule only

379
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,660
slows down growth. But for a while, they

380
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,020
have no

381
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,680
idea what each other's companies are for. Until

382
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,840
a PayPal employee finds a business plan for

383
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,700
x.com in a

384
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,920
dumpster. And then it becomes impossible to ignore

385
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,100
each other. They become two of the biggest

386
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:10,640
fish in

387
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,040
the sea of online payments. PayPal's growing rapidly,

388
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,880
but at the same time bleeding funds.

389
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,560
Every new user gets a cash bonus, most

390
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,180
transactions rack up fees, and servers are expensive.

391
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,200
Worse,

392
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:25,080
the anonymity that makes PayPal attractive also opens

393
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,400
the door to credit card fraud. And PayPal

394
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:27,640
would

395
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,820
have to refund the victim's stolen money. Max

396
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,080
left in response by building an anti-fraud

397
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:33,760
system called

398
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,440
Igor. Software that flags suspicious patterns and blocks

399
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,580
scam transactions. All the while,

400
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,300
user anonymity is still preserved. Igor successfully curbs

401
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,740
fraud by half of what it was. The

402
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,400
FBI takes

403
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,700
interest in the technology and starts using the

404
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,520
software to catch money launderers.

405
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:55,180
Still, PayPal isn't profitable. Peter thinks he knows

406
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,980
the answer. It has to become a monopoly.

407
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,720
Eliminate competitors, dominate the market, and set the

408
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:02,040
rules.

409
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,060
As Peter often puts it. Competition is for

410
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,800
losers. Competition is for losers.

411
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,940
Competition is for losers. This strategy will come

412
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,740
to define Peter Thiel's success.

413
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,600
He'll outline it in the business bestselling book

414
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,480
Zero to One. And it will become a

415
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:16,780
guiding

416
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,180
principle in the tech industry. What I think

417
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,920
everybody who is a founder or entrepreneur should

418
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,400
aim to do is build a monopoly. And

419
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,560
all the great companies that people have built

420
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,940
are monopolies of one

421
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,360
sort or another. By 2000, the online payment

422
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,200
space has grown more competitive. And PayPal is

423
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:35,400
still

424
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,240
operating at a loss. Elon suggests a merger.

425
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,560
And Peter agrees. Uniting is their best chance

426
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,280
for survival.

427
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,080
According to The Contrarian, they clash from the

428
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,380
start. Over the name. Over the software.

429
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,420
Elon becomes CEO because he's a bigger shareholder.

430
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,860
But Peter allegedly can't stand his leadership.

431
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,840
He's set to think Elon's a reckless egomaniac.

432
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,860
And Elon is set to think Peter's a

433
00:17:58,860 --> 00:17:59,720
sociopath who

434
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,440
only cares about money. Their battles stall the

435
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,400
company's growth. So Thiel decides to end them.

436
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,100
Elon goes on his honeymoon, leaving the CEO

437
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,640
position undefended. And in an elegant,

438
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:14,560
calculated move, Peter captures it. Levchin and others

439
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,340
loyal to Thiel start voicing their

440
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:19,120
gripes about Musk. They manage to convince enough

441
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,500
board members to oust Musk and to insert

442
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,100
Thiel as

443
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,800
temporary CEO. A position he'll keep. It won't

444
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,060
be Thiel's last tactical takedown.

445
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,100
As CEO of PayPal, Peter Thiel is on

446
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:39,000
a whole new playing field. In 2002, he

447
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,340
secures a landmark deal.

448
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:44,040
eBay acquires PayPal for 1.5 billion dollars.

449
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,180
Thiel becomes a multi-millionaire at 35 years

450
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:47,540
old,

451
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,300
walking away with at least 55 million dollars

452
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,660
from the deal. Now he has the capital

453
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,580
and credibility

454
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:57,060
to pursue his wildest dreams. The day he

455
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,740
signs the deal is the day he also

456
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,040
steps down as CEO.

457
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,400
PayPal was just a stepping stone. Now he's

458
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,400
ready to move on to bigger and bolder

459
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,860
projects. And to

460
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,820
live the high life as a very rich

461
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,980
person. He buys a silver Ferrari and fancy

462
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,660
apartments. Now the

463
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,680
formerly bullied kid is the life of the

464
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,380
party. More and more people want to be

465
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,120
in his orbit. Thiel's

466
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:25,260
personal trajectory is skyrocketing. But the country is

467
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:25,900
spiraling.

468
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,500
In the wake of 9-11, Americans also

469
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,660
face a recession, an unpopular war and widespread

470
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,260
trauma.

471
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,920
Thiel is anxious too. He's increasingly concerned with

472
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,660
the threat of religious terrorism.

473
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,880
He finds the Bush administration isn't tough enough

474
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,600
on Islam. His politics seem to shift. At

475
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,100
Stanford he wrote fiery libertarian essays railing against

476
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,000
government power. Now he's arguing the

477
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,760
opposite, that the US must use extra judicial

478
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:00,600
methods to catch terrorists. As he put it,

479
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,800
outside the checks and balances of representative democracy

480
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,920
as described in high school textbooks.

481
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,880
For Thiel, the trade-off is clear. The

482
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,300
West must compromise. More security, less freedom. And

483
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:13,400
he

484
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,160
sees a business opportunity in it. What if

485
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,740
Igor, the software Max Levchin built to catch

486
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,300
fraudsters,

487
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,680
could be retooled to catch terrorists? Wouldn't the

488
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,420
CIA be interested? In 2003, Thiel gets a

489
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,080
team to start

490
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,540
working on it right away. They'll call the

491
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:33,780
company Palantir. In The Lord of the Rings,

492
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,420
a Palantir is a mythical stone that sees

493
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:39,760
and communicates across far distances. Sauron,

494
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,100
the evil character who seeks to dominate Middle

495
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,760
-earth, uses a Palantir to spy on enemies

496
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,980
and conspire with

497
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:57,920
allies. Basically, Thiel is offering Sauron's power to

498
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,820
anyone who can afford it. Palantir's promise?

499
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,480
Use network analysis to find unforeseen patterns in

500
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,860
vast troughs of data. This is especially interesting

501
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:10,920
to US intelligence agencies who had collected information

502
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,040
on Al-Qaeda conspirators but failed

503
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,300
to see the connections till after the attack.

504
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,220
In the early years, many users are disappointed

505
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:18,500
with

506
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,720
Palantir's service. But their timing is excellent with

507
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,700
everyone terrified of another attack. And Thiel's

508
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:27,920
chosen CEO is excellent at raising money. His

509
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,580
name is Alex Karp. He's another former Stanford

510
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:31,300
classmate.

511
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,120
When Osama Bin Laden is captured and killed,

512
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,780
rumors circulate that Palantir was used to find

513
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,040
him.

514
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,700
Public interest in the company skyrockets. Based on

515
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,300
what's known today about Palantir's

516
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,140
abilities at the time, any meaningful involvement is

517
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:48,020
questionable. When media outlets ask Alex

518
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,280
Karp about that rumor, he's careful not to

519
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:53,380
confirm or deny involvement. He tends to dodge

520
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:53,880
the question

521
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,300
with a smile and imply that some connection

522
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:00,380
is there. Did your company help to track

523
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:00,920
and kill

524
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,620
Osama Bin Laden?

525
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,960
When you open the paper and look in

526
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:09,480
the news about these kinds of things, there's

527
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,040
a two-thirds chance,

528
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,940
depending on the country involved, that somehow my

529
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,940
company was involved.

530
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,920
One media outlet isn't buying the hype. A

531
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:23,480
gossipy blog called Gawker. According to Max Chafkin,

532
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,340
Gawker's Silicon Valley page reports no real link

533
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,440
between Palantir and the Bin Laden raid,

534
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,340
and suggests the company spread the rumor just

535
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:34,480
to boost sales. Valleyweg is known for roasting

536
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:34,700
the

537
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,040
tech industry back when most news outlets tend

538
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,640
to sing its praises. And a favorite target

539
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,320
of Gawker's

540
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,700
gossip and mockery is Peter Thiel. Thiel will

541
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,200
take care of Gawker later.

542
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,460
Beyond founding Palantir, Thiel spends the 2000s turning

543
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,040
tech startups into giants.

544
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,140
I was the sort of first angel investor

545
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,660
in Facebook in the summer of 2004. The

546
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,360
business was already

547
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,660
tracking quite well. They only needed money to

548
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,460
buy more computers, so I think that was

549
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:00,840
always sort of

550
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,740
a promising sign.

551
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:05,060
In 2004, he becomes Facebook's first big investor.

552
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,100
Thiel not only funds the company,

553
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,660
but becomes Zuckerberg's mentor. Now, Zuckerberg is one

554
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,840
of the richest people alive. And Thiel's

555
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,680
investment will net him about $400 million. Thiel

556
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,880
doesn't stop there. Through his network,

557
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:23,040
he backs Airbnb, Spotify, SpaceX, and later OpenAI.

558
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:26,180
In 2007, Thiel seems to have spotted the

559
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:29,240
financial crisis early. He bets against the US

560
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,360
housing market. The gamble pays off.

561
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,440
A 60% return in just six months.

562
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,700
Banks will collapse, and around 9 million Americans

563
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,000
will

564
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,760
lose their jobs. But for Thiel, it's cause

565
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,860
for celebration. According to Chavkin, he flies his

566
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,500
stuff to Maui, with unlimited tabs for food,

567
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,160
booze, massages, and surfing. We asked Peter Thiel

568
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:50,520
if this

569
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,860
is true, but he didn't answer. But Thiel's

570
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,660
golden run doesn't last. After a string of

571
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,700
bad investments and

572
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,480
mass redemptions, his hedge fund suffers huge losses

573
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,000
and all but collapses. By 2011, he will

574
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,120
have lost nearly two-thirds of his clients'

575
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:09,240
money. The crisis seems to make Thiel more

576
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,180
cynical. In 2009,

577
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,680
he writes that he still believes in libertarian

578
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,600
principles, but no longer in democracy.

579
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,900
I no longer believe that freedom and democracy

580
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:23,500
are compatible, he declares. He argues that America

581
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:23,760
has

582
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,640
been in decline since the 1920s, when women

583
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,160
gained the right to vote, and when the

584
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,800
Great Depression

585
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,280
created mass unemployment. In his view, women and

586
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,140
poor people are especially hostile to libertarian

587
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,280
policies. Their ability to vote stands in the

588
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,180
way of his ideal society.

589
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:44,200
The essay makes waves. Gawker Media calls him

590
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,300
a loopy libertarian, ridiculing him for wishing women

591
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,060
couldn't vote. Thiel later clarifies it's not that

592
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,020
he wants to take one class of voters'

593
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:52,660
rights away.

594
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,860
The problem is that Americans, in general, won't

595
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,560
vote for libertarian policies.

596
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,720
So, better to do away with democracy altogether?

597
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:07,600
Meanwhile, Gawker Media gleefully reports Thiel's investment failures.

598
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:10,480
They claim he exaggerates his net worth and

599
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,160
make fun of his hypocrisies.

600
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,940
Gawker reported on a lot of important topics

601
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,700
other media outlets wouldn't touch

602
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,940
till much later, like the crimes of Harvey

603
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,600
Weinstein and Jeffrey Epstein.

604
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,340
But they also posted a lot of arguably

605
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,400
cruel gossip.

606
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,040
In 2007, they outed Thiel's sexual orientation with

607
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:28,800
a post titled,

608
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,340
Peter Thiel is totally gay people. Peter Thiel's

609
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,460
sexuality was an open secret at the time,

610
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,380
but he didn't seem to want it reported.

611
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,560
His outing was clearly a violation of privacy.

612
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,060
According to The Contrarian, Thiel sees Gawker's coverage

613
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,680
as damaging to his business.

614
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,620
And plenty of other people have grudges against

615
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,120
the side,

616
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,900
so Thiel quietly funds a team of lawyers

617
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,300
to take up their cases.

618
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:56,000
The decisive moment comes in 2012, when Gawker

619
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,040
publishes a leaked

620
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:00,080
sex tape of the wrestler Hulk Hogan. Hogan

621
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,620
sues, and Thiel secretly

622
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,520
bankrolls the fight with $10 million.

623
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:12,360
The stage is set for a major courtroom

624
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:12,780
battle.

625
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,240
Hulk Hogan, former professional wrestler turned reality star,

626
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,740
is taking on media website Gawker.

627
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,860
Gawker is hit with just over $140 million

628
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,980
in damages and files for bankruptcy in 2016.

629
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,380
Gawker Media is no more. And Thiel is

630
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,260
proud of his win,

631
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:32,060
calling it the most philanthropic thing he's ever

632
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:32,360
done.

633
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,200
In an interview, he compares the journalists behind

634
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,660
the company to terrorists.

635
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,780
The world learned that it's dangerous to mess

636
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:40,720
with Peter Thiel.

637
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,720
Reporters Without Borders called his feet a serious

638
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,600
threat on freedom of the press.

639
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,300
Critics argue that this set a precedent for

640
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,500
wealthy individuals to

641
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,460
weaponize the courts and bury media that criticizes

642
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:52,780
them.

643
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,660
But Peter Thiel is just getting started.

644
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,960
It's often said that two things in life

645
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,800
are certain, death and taxes.

646
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,940
Well, Peter Thiel disagrees.

647
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,280
With others see as inevitabilities, Thiel sees as

648
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,660
problems to be solved.

649
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,500
He famously funds biotech companies pursuing life extension.

650
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,800
His hatred of taxes has some poor resources

651
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,440
into anti-tax political actions and also seasteading.

652
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,540
Man-made island nations free from income tax

653
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,960
and governmental regulations.

654
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:31,500
A floating libertarian utopia where he can escape

655
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,200
systems he finds oppressive.

656
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,280
An idea he has since abandoned.

657
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,320
He looks into other exit plans, like a

658
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,340
bunker in New Zealand, which he also later

659
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:40,720
drops.

660
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,420
And the chance for humanity to reach Mars.

661
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,040
This becomes Peter Thiel's pattern.

662
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,460
Seeking escape.

663
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,700
Escape from rules that govern everyone else.

664
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,500
But escape on Peter Thiel's scale doesn't come

665
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:57,960
easily.

666
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,920
Immortality research and space exploration require massive resources.

667
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:06,260
Changing tax laws requires massive influence.

668
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,140
Fortunately for Thiel,

669
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,540
his wealth and influence have grown enormously.

670
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,940
So he can attempt to reshape politics to

671
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,660
enable his search for escape.

672
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,780
In 2007, he does something unusual for Silicon

673
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:20,640
Valley entrepreneurs.

674
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,540
He starts funding presidential candidates.

675
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,580
His first big bet is the libertarian Ron

676
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:26,920
Paul.

677
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,900
A longshot candidate for presidency, but a politician

678
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,180
with a passionate base.

679
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:34,220
Like Thiel, Paul is an advocate for extreme

680
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,520
free market capitalism.

681
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,440
They're also both skeptical of climate change to

682
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,360
different degrees.

683
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,600
Ron Paul doesn't win the 2008 presidency.

684
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,720
Obama does.

685
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,440
In 2012, Ron Paul runs again.

686
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,880
And this time, Thiel is his biggest donor

687
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:49,760
by a longshot.

688
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,500
Thiel wasn't really banking on Paul's win.

689
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,680
Instead, he was thinking ahead.

690
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,180
In an interview with the magazine Slate from

691
00:28:57,180 --> 00:29:00,080
2012, Thiel says he was really campaigning for

692
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:00,840
2016.

693
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,880
Building up a strong libertarian base.

694
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,860
Thiel seems to want a candidate who will

695
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,660
ensure his wealth will be protected.

696
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,520
One who will grant more power to the

697
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,280
tech industry.

698
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,940
And one who shares his view that America

699
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:19,040
is in decline and needs a strong man

700
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,220
to become great again.

701
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,360
When Trump is revealed as the best candidate

702
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,700
to promote those aims,

703
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,920
Thiel donates $1.25 million to his campaign.

704
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:31,340
In 2016, Thiel takes the stage at the

705
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,720
Republican National Convention during primetime.

706
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,080
Tonight, I urge all of my fellow Americans

707
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,920
to stand up and vote for Donald Trump.

708
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,440
Thiel campaigns for Trump as if his views

709
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,740
represented Silicon Valley.

710
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,540
But at the time, Trump is deeply unpopular

711
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:47,080
in tech.

712
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,300
Of the top tech companies in the Valley,

713
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:52,500
not a single CEO donates to Trump's 2016

714
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,060
campaign.

715
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,640
And Thiel's support of Trump makes him somewhat

716
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,520
of a pariah.

717
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,620
According to the contrarian, friends cut ties with

718
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,760
him or refuse to discuss politics.

719
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,500
Thiel is unbothered.

720
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,780
They'll change their tune soon enough.

721
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,520
Besides, he's starting to lean into his image

722
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,440
as the Silicon Valley supervillain.

723
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,100
He reportedly once said,

724
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:15,340
I'd rather be seen as evil than incompetent.

725
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:18,240
When Trump shocks the world by winning, Thiel

726
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,720
is part of the transition team.

727
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,940
His role is to appoint people who will

728
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:24,340
disrupt regulatory bodies like the Federal Trade

729
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,460
Commission and the Food and Drug Administration.

730
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:29,340
A dream job for Thiel, who's railed against

731
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,360
governmental regulation for decades.

732
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,920
Thiel reportedly suggests 150 names to Trump.

733
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,560
According to Max Shevkin, his list includes, to

734
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,480
no surprise, ultra-libertarians.

735
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,780
But also very controversial figures.

736
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,920
Fringe people from his growing network of far

737
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,940
-right reactionaries.

738
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,440
Trump only approves a handful of them.

739
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,340
The least controversial suggestions that Thiel makes.

740
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,400
So Thiel's first attempt at capturing the White

741
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,640
House seems to have failed.

742
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,560
Politically, Thiel retreats to the background for a

743
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:58,760
bit.

744
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
He and his partner have their first child

745
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,820
and he seems to focus on family life

746
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:03,320
for a while.

747
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:06,820
But the background is where Peter Thiel thrives

748
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,380
the most.

749
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,960
Outside of politics, Thiel's businesses are skyrocketing.

750
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,760
Especially Palantir.

751
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,540
During COVID, Palantir wins government contracts to analyze

752
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,380
pandemic data,

753
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,340
tracking infections and vaccines.

754
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,900
In 2025, Business Insider reports that under the

755
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,060
second Trump administration,

756
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,760
ICE will use Palantir to track down immigrants

757
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,040
who overstate their visas.

758
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,780
Palantir's involvement has only intensified under Trump and

759
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,780
has been instrumental for over a decade

760
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,740
since Obama's second administration.

761
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:40,580
The Guardian reports in 2025 that Palantir provides

762
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,340
ICE with tools that help their agents

763
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:45,940
fulfill Trump's aggressive deportation quotas using a vast

764
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:46,740
data network.

765
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,780
It includes government records such as text data

766
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,840
from the IRS and private databases

767
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,180
like location history from cell phone records.

768
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,260
Now Palantir also incorporates facial recognition data from

769
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,100
Clearview AI,

770
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,800
another startup where Peter Thiel is the first

771
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,300
investor.

772
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,640
The pattern is clear.

773
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:07,020
Palantir thrives in chaos.

774
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,740
And chaos is only ramping up.

775
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:16,520
What looks like a political setback with Trump

776
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,620
may just be Thiel's chance to plan his

777
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,280
next move.

778
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,500
Thiel won't back Trump's second campaign, but he

779
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,420
will build up another politician.

780
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,240
We're effectively run in this country via the

781
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,500
Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs,

782
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,660
by a bunch of childless cat ladies who

783
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,380
are miserable at their own lives and the

784
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,400
choices that they've made.

785
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:39,280
Thiel injects J.D. Vance's primary campaign with

786
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,080
$15 million.

787
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,360
Vance is now Vice President of the United

788
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:43,980
States.

789
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,080
Thiel and Vance's relationship didn't come out of

790
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:47,440
nowhere.

791
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,200
Vance worked at one of Thiel's companies and

792
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,940
Thiel became his mentor, as Vance himself says.

793
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,480
And it was also Thiel who brought J

794
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,360
.D. Vance and Donald Trump together.

795
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,320
After Trump is elected as president again in

796
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,180
2024, several members of the tech elite rally

797
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:04,880
behind him.

798
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,360
There's Elon Musk, who is against Trump in

799
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,300
2016 and becomes his most visible supporter in

800
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:10,900
2024.

801
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,460
There's Mark Zuckerberg, who abolishes fact-checkers at

802
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,600
Meta less than two weeks before Trump takes

803
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,000
office.

804
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,860
And there's Sundar Pekai, the CEO of Google,

805
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,520
who donates $1 million to Trump just before

806
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,260
inauguration.

807
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,900
At the inauguration of Trump's second presidency in

808
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:30,600
January 2025, major tech CEOs are clearly visible

809
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,460
in the front row.

810
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:41,980
Instead, he watches Palantir's stock skyrocket and topping

811
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,820
the market for much of 2025.

812
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,480
The surge is in part fueled by government

813
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,140
contracts.

814
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,900
Palantir has been hired by Israeli forces allegedly

815
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:55,360
to enable AI power targeting of Palestinians, which

816
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,880
the company denies, and by Ukraine in its

817
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,920
war against Russia.

818
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:02,780
These and other contracts not only boost Palantir's

819
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:05,760
profits, they also give the company access to

820
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,420
extremely sensitive data.

821
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,940
Few assets carry more power or more potential

822
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:11,580
for harm.

823
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,200
So, who decides how it's used?

824
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:18,620
We reached out to Peter Thiel as well

825
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,220
as Palantir because we had a lot of

826
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:20,700
questions.

827
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,140
Unfortunately, none of them were answered.

828
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,240
In 2012, Peter Thiel said,

829
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,620
One of the things I like about technology

830
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:33,420
is that when technology is unregulated, you can

831
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,900
change the world without getting approval from other

832
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,340
people.

833
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:39,260
At its best, it's not subject to democratic

834
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:42,560
control and not subject to the majority, which

835
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,940
I think is often hostile to change.

836
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,980
A recent venture Thiel backed is called Erebor,

837
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,340
a crypto bank named after the mountain in

838
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,700
The Hobbit where a murderous dragon hordes treasure.

839
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,340
And now Trump is pushing one of Thiel's

840
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:58,840
wilder ideas, low-tax freedom cities where corporations

841
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,960
can operate without federal regulations.

842
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,400
We'll actually build new cities in our country

843
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:04,940
again.

844
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:09,220
These freedom cities will reopen the frontier, reignite

845
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:10,540
American imagination.

846
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:13,040
Freedom cities aren't just for making a lot

847
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:13,500
of money.

848
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,080
The goal is also to conduct research without

849
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,240
governmental approval.

850
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,940
One such place already exists, Prospera in Honduras.

851
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,560
You already know who helped fund it.

852
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,040
The libertarian utopia Peter Thiel dreams of no

853
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,380
longer needs Mars or the open ocean.

854
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,200
It's being built right in America.
