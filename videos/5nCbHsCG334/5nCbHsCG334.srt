1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
All right everybody we're thrilled to have the

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:05,360
one the only Satya Nadella here the third

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:10,480
CEO of Microsoft for a impromptu fireside chat

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,420
with David Sachs our czar of AI and

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:20,840
crypto Satya third CEO of Microsoft born in

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,400
India what an incredible story came here right

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,980
after college and you had a little round

8
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,820
trip to pick up your wife

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,720
in your book to bring her here tell

10
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,780
everybody briefly uh how that occurred well um

11
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,900
uh you know so that's that's a great

12
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,760
story of uh the uh the labyrinth that

13
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,940
is the immigration policies of the united states

14
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,300
i think um i uh but my wife

15
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,940
and i went to college together in india

16
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,000
i came here for grad school we then

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,040
got married uh i got my green card

18
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,800
um and she couldn't come join me

19
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,260
because we got married um because we got

20
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,440
married so the story goes basically i had

21
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,800
to give up my green card so the

22
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,680
funny thing is i went to the american

23
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,360
embassy in delhi and i said where's the

24
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,000
line to give up my green card and

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,460
they said there is no such a line

26
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,940
um that would be a crazy thing to

27
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,840
do in the 90s so it was a

28
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,520
strange thing to give up your green card

29
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,640
get an h1 so that she could join

30
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,760
but it all worked out so um you

31
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,780
know it's a long lost memory but it

32
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,780
was you know a way to work around

33
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,720
it um i wanted to ask

34
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:35,140
to ask you uh having launched a copilot

35
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,720
first with github then having a copilot on

36
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,420
the desktop you made a very bold move

37
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,660
for microsoft to put that in the windows

38
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,620
product which i use every day on the

39
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,320
desktop but you did that before it really

40
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,720
could recognize the file system and interact with

41
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,420
applications got a little bit of a lukewarm

42
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:55,300
reception but now you've been doubling down doubling

43
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,900
down and there seems to be

44
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,260
in my estimation three modalities for knowledge workers

45
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:05,200
elon's building at xai what they're calling a

46
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,880
human emulator if you saw that leak

47
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,940
this week yeah uh where they're just building

48
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:12,120
employees and just putting them into their chat

49
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:12,900
rooms and email

50
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,560
then you have claude came out with co

51
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,960
-work this week incredibly powerful people are kind

52
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:18,880
of losing their minds

53
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,560
over it i've been playing with it for

54
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,120
the last 40 hours truly impressive what's your

55
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,740
vision for

56
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:28,320
microsoft and how knowledge workers will actually put

57
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,580
this to use because there seems to be

58
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,340
a gap between

59
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,000
you know playing around with chat tpt and

60
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,020
getting some interesting results and getting business results

61
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,120
yeah so i think it one of the

62
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:43,520
most uh perhaps illustrative examples um of trying

63
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,200
to understand these

64
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,400
various form factors is looking at coding which

65
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,220
is obviously a form of knowledge work or

66
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,120
uh probably

67
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,420
the best example of knowledge work and if

68
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,460
you think about the journey coding has been

69
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,520
it started with

70
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,820
essentially uh uh the next edit suggest right

71
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,420
that was the first time in fact my

72
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,100
own belief in this entire

73
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,560
generation of tech really sort of got formulated

74
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,140
when i started seeing i think this you

75
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:10,760
know there's a

76
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,520
codex model back in the day it was

77
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,680
pre-gpt 3.5 uh that's when next

78
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,580
edit suggestions started working

79
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,920
with some real accuracy then we went to

80
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,140
chat then we went to actions and now

81
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:24,720
to full autonomous agents

82
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,680
and then the autonomous agents can be both

83
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,060
a foreground background in the cloud or local

84
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:31,800
right so that's

85
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,300
all the form factors that exist today when

86
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,000
you're coding and interestingly enough if you look

87
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,280
at it

88
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,560
you use all of them right it's not

89
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,620
like there's only one form factor so that's

90
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,340
i think probably one

91
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,720
of the other lessons so for example when

92
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,160
i'm in a cli i can you go

93
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:48,200
a foreground agent background agent

94
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,160
and then just literally go edit in vs

95
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,740
code right there all happening in parallel right

96
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:54,680
so that sort of

97
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,560
shows how these form factors even compose so

98
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,260
then you bring that to knowledge work to

99
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,160
your point we

100
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,460
started with chat chat with reasoning sort of

101
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:09,300
goes beyond just request response because you now

102
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:09,660
have

103
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,940
that chain of thought uh where you can

104
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,560
see it work now they're actions right essentially

105
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,200
either through

106
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,580
computer use or through uh if you know

107
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:23,160
basically skills uh and agent calls so you

108
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,180
can do actions so

109
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,980
that's kind of the state of the copilot

110
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,800
today now there is a way to think

111
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,780
about you know the the

112
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,060
theory of the mind evolution right because you

113
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,620
need like if you remember you know jobs

114
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,260
had the best

115
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,740
line i would say for pcs or computers

116
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,660
was to say if you it's a bicycle

117
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,840
for the mind uh bill had a line

118
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,760
which i liked as well which was it's

119
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,400
information at your fingertips we kind of need

120
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,420
now a new concept

121
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,600
metaphor for how we use computers in the

122
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,320
ai age and you have one and the

123
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,600
one i like actually came from

124
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,220
the ceo notion which i like you know

125
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,760
that manager of incredible product yeah you haven't

126
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:01,260
bought it yet

127
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,360
yeah i've not bought that uh but the

128
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,600
it's both even management you know basically um

129
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,380
a manager of

130
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,740
infinite minds that's a nice way to think

131
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,920
about it right when you sort of really

132
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,080
look at all the

133
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,100
agents that you are working with you kind

134
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,400
of need to understand what i in fact

135
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,860
the other term i like is we

136
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,220
macro delegate and micro steal in fact you

137
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,140
kind of need that in in in coding

138
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,100
you kind of have it right

139
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,240
so you do a macro delegation and then

140
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,540
i can in parallel give it instructions while

141
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,320
it is doing

142
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,480
work so that's sort of the state even

143
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,580
today of copilot or what have you you

144
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,800
bring up a little bit

145
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,380
of one of one of the form factors

146
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,020
i'm very excited about and you'll see us

147
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,700
even in the next week even

148
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,520
do things is while i'm sitting in github

149
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,520
copilot what it's not as if software developers

150
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:52,960
sit in

151
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,180
isolation right it's not like the only thing

152
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,380
i work on is my repo i attend

153
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,640
meetings um i write specs or

154
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,960
others have written specs that i'm implementing i

155
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:06,320
need to have my repo be consistent with

156
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:06,600
that

157
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,360
so that means using either a straightforward mcp

158
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,460
server or a skill i want to be

159
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,660
able to call into

160
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:15,460
my work iq which is the copilot bring

161
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:19,580
that in that's the type of composition uh

162
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,620
of knowledge work

163
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,720
that'll happen same thing with security say you're

164
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,720
a security professional you have lots of logs

165
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,300
uh

166
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,600
how do you sort of really analyze them

167
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,660
you drop them into a file system then

168
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,960
write code on top of

169
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,420
it create a dashboard what have you those

170
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,300
are the types of knowledge work that we

171
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:35,860
can enable

172
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,100
then i think you bring up one more

173
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,140
thing which is can you create quote unquote

174
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,200
digital employees

175
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,280
digital co-workers or what have you and

176
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,360
it's all about credentials right so the i

177
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,580
today you could like

178
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,080
you can literally assign you working on that

179
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,960
as well yeah so in fact we introduced

180
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,320
something

181
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,860
called agent 365 as a way to give

182
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:56,260
identities in fact extending the identities we have

183
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:56,880
for humans

184
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,720
today uh and the endpoint protection we have

185
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,340
for their compute devices to agents so you

186
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:02,860
might clone

187
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:05,260
me working in the hr department or working

188
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,500
in the marketing department and have a virtual

189
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,340
version of me

190
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,560
inside of office that's correct so so there

191
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,500
are two sort of modalities there one is

192
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,460
you give every

193
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,700
knowledge worker infinite minds that's kind of one

194
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:20,820
and then you create even infinite minds independent

195
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,220
of the your identity because the identity is

196
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,420
one of the key things you got to

197
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,040
get right even for it to

198
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,360
work right so for permissions and decision making

199
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,660
permission decision making and like one of the

200
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:31,960
key

201
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,860
things is who did what to whom is

202
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,040
sort of the most important query in an

203
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,440
organization right at the end of

204
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,660
the day the organization needs to understand what

205
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,720
work got done and what's the provenance of

206
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,340
that work

207
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,400
and how do you trace it back right

208
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,220
so therefore you kind of want either what

209
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,480
if it's a human with a lot

210
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,020
of agents then it's really macro delegation micro

211
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,600
stating by the human whose identity was passed

212
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:57,820
on

213
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:01,120
so it's delegation versus a separate identity and

214
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,540
that was done by a level of management

215
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,220
product

216
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:08,680
management that you've eliminated that alphabet's eliminated meta

217
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,500
has started to eliminate in their

218
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,180
organization four years ago you had the same

219
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,980
number of employees you have at microsoft now

220
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,420
but you put a

221
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,900
90 billion dollars onto the top line of

222
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,000
the revenue in that time and you doubled

223
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,340
your income during that

224
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,040
time so how did that happen is that

225
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,500
automation of those jobs is that you were

226
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,380
a little bit over staffed

227
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:33,120
and i think it's it's actually you're pulling

228
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,140
on a very interesting thread which is at

229
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:35,580
some level

230
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,580
what's the big structural change that needs to

231
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,520
happen in fact i would say this is

232
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,440
probably the

233
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,500
biggest change in knowledge work since pcs i

234
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,100
mean i always you know think about like

235
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,040
how did work happen

236
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,400
pre-pcs right i mean think about a

237
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,360
multinational company like ours trying to do a

238
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,120
forecast uh right

239
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,420
faxes went around inter-office memos got sent

240
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,220
and then you kind of created a you

241
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,200
know a forecast

242
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,100
then suddenly you know pcs became standard issue

243
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,380
uh you put an excel spreadsheet put some

244
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:05,760
numbers

245
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,760
sent it in email everybody entered numbers and

246
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,980
you had a forecast so the work the

247
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,580
work artifact and the

248
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,040
workflow all changed that's what's happening so for

249
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,060
example i'll give you uh at linkedin uh

250
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,020
we used to

251
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:22,800
have product managers we had designers uh we

252
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,580
had front-end engineers and then we had

253
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,800
back-end engineers

254
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,820
and so on so what we did is

255
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,980
we sort of took those first four roles

256
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,140
and combined them in fact increased

257
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,700
scope and said let's they're all full stack

258
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,600
builders so i like that because that's a

259
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,580
structural change

260
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:42,260
that allows for us to increase the change

261
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:45,360
both the work and the workflow between these

262
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,180
functions and i

263
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,820
would assume the velocity because you don't have

264
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,520
four people communicating and that throughput of ideas

265
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,600
it's just one person and vibe coding exactly

266
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,680
and there's a new workflow so at the

267
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,480
same time as you

268
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,500
can imagine if to build an ai product

269
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,920
today there's a complete new workflow right it

270
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,060
starts with evals

271
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:05,340
right so basically there's this eval to science

272
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:09,120
to infrastructure and so evals are done by

273
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,540
these full

274
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,660
stack builders and what have you and product

275
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,340
managers in the new form the infrastructure is

276
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:14,520
built

277
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,340
by the systems engineers at the back end

278
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,560
because they support the science that supports the

279
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,220
product so in

280
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:22,040
some sense there's a new loop uh and

281
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,620
you have to structurally change and so a

282
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:25,240
lot of what is

283
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:29,140
happening inside of tech is that change uh

284
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,720
which is i think going to be pretty

285
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,140
massive uh and at the

286
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,760
same time a company like ours i have

287
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,540
to do everything it's not like i can

288
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,100
just so go live in the future i

289
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,100
have to make sure we're doing a fantastic

290
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,740
job of doing hot patching on windows is

291
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,780
done with quality

292
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,580
while at the same time building the evals

293
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,620
that are improving co-pilot quality right and

294
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,300
so both of

295
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,540
those have to be first class i assume

296
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,420
this is the most challenging moment of your

297
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,260
career because

298
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:57,440
microsoft was so dominant duopoly in some spaces

299
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,860
um but you really weren't up against the

300
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,480
competition

301
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,060
level you're up against now i was talking

302
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,760
to elon you know and he was sort

303
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,940
of saying well building

304
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,240
cars was pretty easy uh because i was

305
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,160
up against the legacy car makers and now

306
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,720
i'm up against just look

307
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:16,760
at the set you're up against yeah it's

308
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,700
a pretty intense time i mean so the

309
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,140
way i i always think

310
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:23,200
is it's always helpful uh when you have

311
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,780
a complete new set of competitors every decade

312
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,380
because that

313
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,400
keeps you fit uh if you think about

314
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,380
it i joined uh microsoft in 92 when

315
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,080
i had novell as the big

316
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:37,280
existential competitor we had um uh and here

317
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,120
we are in 2026 uh and you're absolutely

318
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,620
right it's a

319
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,320
pretty intense time i'm glad there's the competition

320
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,540
it's it's quite honestly at the end of

321
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,040
the day when

322
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,480
i look at it right as a percentage

323
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,100
of gdp five years from now where will

324
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,540
tech be right uh it will be higher

325
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,900
so we are blessed to be in this

326
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,660
industry it's a lot of intense competition but

327
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,420
it's not so zero sum

328
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,220
as some people make it out high it's

329
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,400
getting much bigger much the tam and the

330
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,380
it's just the impact

331
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,820
of this tech is going to be so

332
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:09,900
massive um the question then of course is

333
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,440
what is like i i'm always

334
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,740
go back to what's the brand identity microsoft

335
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,720
has brand permission we have what do customers

336
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,240
expect

337
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,620
from us it's sometimes we kind of overthink

338
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,260
somehow that every customer wants the same thing

339
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,580
from all of the competitors and finding that

340
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,380
out right it's kind of a different take

341
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:27,960
on the peter

342
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,680
deal thing which is you've got to avoid

343
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:35,000
competition by really understanding what customers really want

344
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,220
from you uh versus thinking everybody's a competitor

345
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,960
david yeah so there are a lot of

346
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,540
heads of state

347
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:44,100
here obviously at davos as well as ceos

348
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,360
of fortune 500 companies and i think you

349
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,060
got asked a question

350
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,500
last night at the dinner about how they

351
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,700
should think about ai and how to be

352
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,600
successful and i recall

353
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,160
they used the word diffusion and i was

354
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,000
wondering if you could expand on those remarks

355
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,680
because that

356
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,580
really resonated with some of the policy work

357
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,500
i've been doing no absolutely in fact uh

358
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,160
what you all have

359
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,740
been doing to make sure in in this

360
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,800
context of the american tech stack um is

361
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,280
broadly used around the world

362
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,500
and is trusted around the world because i

363
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,300
think uh when i look back david to

364
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,040
me um uh at the end of the

365
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,260
day

366
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,460
uh you create the technology but really the

367
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:29,280
benefits come only by intense use in fact

368
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,560
one of my favorite

369
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,520
studies has always been this work that uh

370
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,520
an economist i think or a dartman did

371
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,820
uh his name is diego

372
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:40,000
common where he studied uh basically what happened

373
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,280
during the industrial revolution um how did countries

374
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,020
get ahead um and the simple sort of

375
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:49,240
take away from that was any country uh

376
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,760
that brought the latest

377
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:54,900
technology into their uh country and then did

378
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,040
value add technology on top of it right

379
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,600
so it's like

380
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,180
don't reinvent the wheel bring the latest and

381
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,500
then build on top of it that's to

382
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,160
me uh what happens you

383
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,860
know when you have diffusion so especially with

384
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,840
general purpose technology like ai it needs to

385
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,140
spread

386
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,720
like right in our you know in our

387
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,720
own country in the united states we now

388
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,520
need we have the tech the

389
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,240
question is is it being used in healthcare

390
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,180
is it being used um in financial services

391
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,080
is it being used

392
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,140
in every sector of the economy by large

393
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:25,340
businesses small business public sector um so to

394
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,960
me under unless

395
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,840
and until we see that diffusion and intense

396
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,200
use uh we're not going to have the

397
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,740
success um uh and so that's

398
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,340
the phase we are in it's you know

399
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,940
it's diffusing faster um and so some of

400
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,200
the work policy work you

401
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,220
have done um and in general all you

402
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:45,140
know the good news here is the technology

403
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,000
is there the rails around

404
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,860
cloud and mobile that were laid out make

405
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,800
it possible for this thing to spread right

406
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,720
it's not you know

407
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,140
impossible to get the tokens the question is

408
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,020
what are the use cases how do and

409
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,120
how do you manage the

410
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,020
change in all of that um you know

411
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,640
like one of the questions at least in

412
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,960
davos is it's one thing for

413
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,040
the west and the developed nations what about

414
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,720
the global south um i think global south

415
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,240
has a huge

416
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,520
opportunity to quite frankly because to me like

417
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,120
let's say you know 40 50 of the

418
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,260
gdp of most global

419
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,780
south countries is public sector so just imagine

420
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:22,380
this tech making a difference in how the

421
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:22,840
governments

422
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,940
really parlay the taxpayer money into services for

423
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,060
citizens and there's if there's efficiency gains

424
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,400
that's probably a couple of points of gdp

425
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,460
growth right there and so i'm very optimistic

426
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,220
that there's

427
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,360
going to be a poll uh and that

428
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,800
we should as the united states given the

429
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,260
technology stack we have

430
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:44,640
uh in europe in asia in you know

431
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,420
in south america in africa and everywhere else

432
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,960
uh get it to be broadly

433
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,220
deployed one of the questions i get asked

434
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,200
a lot about the ai race is how

435
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,020
do you know if you're winning

436
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,480
or how do you know if the united

437
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:00,540
states is ahead of its global competitors and

438
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,400
the answer i give is

439
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,480
market share you know if we look around

440
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,320
the world in five years and we see

441
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,200
that american companies

442
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:11,200
american technology has say 80 market share it

443
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,580
means we did a good job if we

444
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,260
look around the world in

445
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,460
five years and see that it's say chinese

446
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,900
chips and chinese models that are being used

447
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,300
all over the

448
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,060
world well means we probably lost so you

449
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,620
know ultimately usage is the proof of the

450
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,120
pudding is in the

451
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,320
eating of it i mean the in this

452
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,540
case the way that you know that you're

453
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,620
succeeding is through market

454
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,060
shares through usage i and i i would

455
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,160
agree with that but david since you even

456
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:36,900
worked at microsoft

457
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,940
for a few years um you know one

458
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,660
of the things that i'm very grounded on

459
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,240
is always uh that bill

460
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,320
gates line of a platform right so one

461
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,800
of the things that i always think about

462
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,900
is it's market share but

463
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,360
it's also ecosystem effects right see what the

464
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,160
united states always has done is not just

465
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:54,440
about

466
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,180
our market share or even um the revenues

467
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,080
to u.s companies in fact one of

468
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,060
the things i learned at

469
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,340
microsoft is whenever i did a country visit

470
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:06,480
the data i would first study is in

471
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,980
let's say in the uk or in

472
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,720
switzerland or what have you is what is

473
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,300
the total employment created in switzerland uh in

474
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:14,900
our channel

475
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,600
that used to be like the number one

476
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,420
thing uh in our country reports right and

477
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,680
the total number like the

478
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:24,100
number of it workers the number of office

479
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:27,600
workers channel so channel partners is isvs so

480
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,080
the number of

481
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,140
isvs uh who were there so we used

482
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,160
to have a complete marker of how did

483
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,380
the ecosystem around the platform

484
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:38,020
get built one country at a time and

485
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,080
that is what the united states has always

486
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,740
done in fact the u.s tech

487
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:46,440
stack including in china got built because others

488
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,340
built around our text the same thing is

489
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:49,560
going to

490
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,960
happen so that's why i think the work

491
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,200
you're doing around diffusion right is about really

492
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,100
increasing

493
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,400
the size of the pie the trust in

494
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,320
the platform so that there is true economic

495
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,860
opportunity quite frankly

496
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,300
well you're right and i remember actually you're

497
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,320
you brought back some memories from this is

498
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:06,600
about a

499
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,920
decade ago when my company yamra was acquired

500
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,420
by microsoft we were part of uh the

501
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,220
sharepoint group and

502
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:15,200
i remember that the um the product managers

503
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,860
there were very proud of the fact that

504
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,200
the revenue from the

505
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:24,080
sharepoint ecosystem meaning non-microsoft the um the

506
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,740
consulting community the implementers who would

507
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,880
go into companies implement sharepoint i think their

508
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,500
revenue is something like seven times greater than

509
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,580
microsoft's own software revenue and i think in

510
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:37,320
aggregate and i think and i think bill

511
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:37,920
had a line

512
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,160
about you're not an ecosystem or a platform

513
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,080
until the revenue on top of your platform

514
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,820
is some you know

515
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,920
factor of your own revenue that's right and

516
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,600
and i and i think that i think

517
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,280
what's really important

518
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,540
about this is when we talk about diffusion

519
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:54,020
and obviously want the united states to have

520
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:54,940
this leading

521
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,100
position it doesn't mean it's bad for the

522
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,820
rest of the world because they're able to

523
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,760
build on top of

524
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,660
those platforms and create even more value 100

525
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,820
in fact that's sort of the most important

526
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,440
point right

527
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,020
so this is not that this is not

528
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:11,160
about american tech um and american revenues to

529
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,060
the united states it's

530
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:15,420
actually creating opportunity using a new platform everywhere

531
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,620
and in fact you know you know like

532
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,040
i

533
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,560
remember i worked on our database products uh

534
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,100
in the 90s uh you know with sap

535
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,420
in fact the combination

536
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:28,940
of uh sql server and r3 were successful

537
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,700
on both sides there's a lot talked about

538
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,720
intel and microsoft

539
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,620
but one of the other things that i

540
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,960
grew up in which has sort of been

541
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,620
foundational in how i look at the

542
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:39,080
world is what we did with a european

543
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,080
software company that is still uh you know

544
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,280
a giant and so

545
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,960
that you know who knows what the next

546
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,360
big ai app will be and where and

547
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,720
what will happen but uh i i sort

548
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,880
of go in with the attitude that there

549
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,740
will be tech companies uh maybe even top

550
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:55,300
five tech companies that

551
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:58,100
could emerge everywhere with even the american tech

552
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:02,140
stack you have um done some amazing acquisitions

553
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:02,300
and

554
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,700
you're quite a deal maker on top of

555
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,860
being a technologist it's probably the least reported

556
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,900
aspect of your spectacular tenure and the massive

557
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,760
growth you've had but you did a deal

558
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,700
with open ai

559
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:18,300
and probably one of the most savvy slash

560
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,620
controversial deal makers of all time sam altman

561
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:22,400
that deal was

562
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,940
looked at as you you you're you're set

563
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,460
up to get a windfall in cash which

564
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,700
you don't need as microsoft

565
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,020
always nice i'm guess guessing if they ipo

566
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:34,680
but did you create potentially and this was

567
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,540
the criticism of

568
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:40,320
it an ultimate competitor to microsoft and how

569
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,140
do you think about that and how can

570
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,160
microsoft which

571
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:46,020
missed steve bomber's biggest regret missing the mobile

572
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:49,940
revolution how can you not have a gemini

573
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:53,200
an xai a claude that is your own

574
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,620
or in your mind do you have that

575
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,160
because you have the source code of open

576
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,740
ai yeah i think that that's right so

577
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,700
when when people say uh where is your

578
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,760
foundation model i mean

579
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,720
at the end of the day we do

580
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,020
have the ip but that said i think

581
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,380
you bring up a couple different things

582
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:09,140
right one is to us the most important

583
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,680
thing when i look at what is microsoft's

584
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,100
strategy today one is

585
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,480
we want to build token factories right so

586
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,920
our biggest business today is azure business and

587
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,740
the azure business

588
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,040
the tam given what's going to happen is

589
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,900
is so huge that we now need to

590
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,860
be fantastic uh at building

591
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,420
these token factories and um that means a

592
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,600
heterogeneous fleet of infrastructure and that

593
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,860
every hyperscaler is always done which is use

594
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,640
software to make maximum use of it and

595
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,600
for tco and

596
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,200
utilization so that's one side of it then

597
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,140
there's the app server business right which is

598
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:42,820
everybody

599
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,700
we you talked about like if everyone's going

600
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,140
to be building agents have infinite minds have

601
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,000
these rl

602
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,660
gems have evals what have you there's an

603
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,560
entire just like every platform has had an

604
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,060
app server

605
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,160
server this one has an app server that's

606
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,000
what we're doing with foundry and what have

607
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:57,240
you right

608
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,500
so there's an app server business in that

609
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,220
app server one of the things that structurally

610
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:02,900
now is pretty

611
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,360
clear is anyone building any application or any

612
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,620
company is going to use not one model

613
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,300
but all the

614
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,260
models right why would i not right which

615
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:14,220
is in fact i will orchestrate for any

616
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,840
given task even multiple

617
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,400
models right there's this one nice thing that

618
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,340
we came out in our healthcare practice called

619
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,020
the decision

620
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:24,880
orchestrator what it proves is that by assigning

621
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,820
roles right so investigator data analyst domain

622
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:32,520
expert just giving even prompted roles to models

623
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:36,140
and then orchestrating them gets better results than

624
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,560
any one single frontier model am i right

625
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,380
to read into that then that you're bullish

626
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,280
on the open source

627
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,900
models and think large language models will largely

628
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,300
be commoditized and that's not where the value

629
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:47,520
will

630
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,900
accrue in fact the way i think about

631
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,280
it is that just like what happened apple

632
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,260
thinks that too by

633
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,280
the way what the way you think about

634
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,280
what happened in the database market right you

635
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,480
know i used to be

636
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,740
like everything is just a sql database until

637
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,500
it was not right there was i mean

638
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,040
think about it there

639
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:05,400
dock databases there is no sql databases the

640
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,480
proliferation of database right who would have thought

641
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,820
that the database market would have such a

642
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,760
richness to it or that it could ever

643
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,060
be open source that was

644
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,040
that's my i mean talk about postgres or

645
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,580
what has happened even with mongo which is

646
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,360
open but there

647
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,940
are even companies that have backed it and

648
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,820
so so to me that's what's going to

649
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,420
happen and to me a model

650
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,940
is like the database market you know it's

651
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,920
got it's gone differences but i sort of

652
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,940
somehow think that

653
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,400
it's not they're definitely going to be frontier

654
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,520
models that are close source you know they're

655
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:33,600
going

656
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,000
to be open source models that are going

657
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,980
to be uh uh frontier class in fact

658
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,560
if anything i think in this

659
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,340
next year what will be probably a big

660
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:45,660
part of the discussion is what's the future

661
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,880
of a firm a firm

662
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:51,620
should be able to take the tacit knowledge

663
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:56,400
it has and embed it inside awaits in

664
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,460
a model that they

665
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,900
control right so when somebody asked me how

666
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,560
many models should be there i'll say as

667
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,400
many models as

668
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,400
firms in the world right that's sort of

669
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,640
the extreme way uh because because to me

670
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,920
that's how i think

671
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,380
this this knowledge economy becomes an ai economy

672
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,840
are you secretly and you can say it

673
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,140
here since

674
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:18,300
we're on all in working on an llm

675
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,580
to exist on the windows desktop because that

676
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,860
you are you have it like

677
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,560
today there's a phi silica model which is

678
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:29,460
completely resident using npus and of course using

679
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,580
uh gpus in

680
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:34,120
fact the largest installation um of high power

681
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,460
in fact it's one of the fascinating the

682
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,180
workstation is

683
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,540
back i'm one of the most if you

684
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:40,420
went to cus great it's so microsoft because

685
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,620
yeah you have a nice

686
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:44,400
desktop business oh absolutely and so we and

687
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,120
in fact we think that that form factor

688
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,460
especially i mean

689
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,560
i i always say this which is uh

690
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,080
you know i started my career on a

691
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,980
command line who knows i may just end

692
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,480
it in a command line but you started

693
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,780
at sun which was the original five ten

694
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,080
thousand dollar workstation do

695
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:01,240
you see a time where you'll be meeting

696
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,560
with your customers here and advocating a ten

697
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,240
twenty thousand

698
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,320
dollar desktop machine that has an llm and

699
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,140
the hardware you can put a dgx card

700
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,440
and you can have

701
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,100
like just a fantastic machine and the models

702
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,600
i and by the way you know we

703
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,460
are one architecture tweak away

704
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:20,140
from even having some kind of a distributed

705
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:23,100
model architecture right even an moe architecture that

706
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,360
shows knows how to really distribute itself right

707
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,160
that's the type of breakthrough that can completely

708
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,260
change uh what hybrid ai may look like

709
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:35,460
but we're absolutely committed and focused on making

710
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,240
the pc

711
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,480
a great place for local models uh and

712
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,680
local models that then do even a lot

713
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,120
of the prompt processing and

714
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,760
call into the cloud right so there's a

715
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,240
whole lot of work that can happen and

716
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,060
that's sort of definitely

717
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,020
something that's in that way yeah i think

718
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:51,040
that the clog co-work has kind of

719
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,100
shown the power of tapping

720
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,620
into the local file drive and be able

721
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,780
to use that that that brings up another

722
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,540
point you you got me

723
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,500
thinking about yammer and for people don't know

724
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,540
um you know yammer's claim to fame this

725
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,280
is about 15

726
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,380
years ago was that it pioneered a lot

727
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,140
of um well it used a lot of

728
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,880
consumer growth tactics to attack

729
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,500
enterprise software i'm wondering as you think about

730
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:13,500
enterprise adoption of ai how do you think

731
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:13,940
it's

732
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,620
going to spread over the next year it

733
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,360
feels like we're at sort of a a

734
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,660
a critical point do you think it's

735
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,040
going to be top down is it going

736
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,080
to come from the ceo directing a team

737
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,520
giving them a strategic

738
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,120
transformation project or they're going to do an

739
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,400
rfp or do you think it's going to

740
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,520
spread bottom up

741
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,600
in the enterprise through ai native employees who

742
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,320
are adaptable who are using the tools in

743
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:36,580
their own

744
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,700
lives and they start to bring these things

745
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,960
to work and start accomplishing amazing things yeah

746
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,280
no i

747
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,120
think you know like all things david i

748
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,760
think it's both the top down bottom up

749
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,540
right uh the the reason i

750
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,580
say that uh top down is if i

751
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:52,620
look at the roi uh of uh applying

752
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:55,440
ai and customer service uh or in supply

753
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,560
chain or in hr self-service those are

754
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:03,320
the easy projects where uh it and cxos

755
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,600
can make calls and

756
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,980
that's where you're seeing the first drop of

757
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:10,140
uh real ai adoption but the bottom up

758
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,660
is what ultimately

759
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,800
will happen right i mean even with the

760
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,760
pcs in fact if you think back at

761
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,500
it the lawyers brought word in

762
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:20,240
and then finance bought excel in and then

763
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,360
email came and then it became standard issue

764
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,440
that's what's

765
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,240
happening right now so for example these agents

766
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,460
when i sort of talk about everybody's building

767
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:28,980
agents

768
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,460
they're figuring out a way to go create

769
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:36,100
these things that are changing workflow and removing

770
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:36,640
drudgery

771
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,980
in their work right that's sort of the

772
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:42,100
beginning of what is a bottom-up transformation

773
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,760
um you didn't

774
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,880
i was in fact the thing that i'm

775
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,920
most excited about is this bottom-up change

776
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,860
even at microsoft for

777
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:52,520
example we manage something like 500 odd fiber

778
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,240
operators around the world in in azure today

779
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:55,860
and

780
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,440
by the way i had not myself realized

781
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,600
it a lot of it you know it's

782
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,740
called devops but it's a it's a physical

783
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:03,580
asset things get cut and when you sort

784
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,540
of say devops that means you literally are

785
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,580
emailing people and

786
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:08,180
saying hey what happened to that fiber cut

787
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,560
how do we repair it so there's a

788
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,000
lot of back and forth

789
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,880
so this network the person who runs our

790
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,680
global network basically has built to your point

791
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:16,900
about

792
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:20,300
these personas they're just digital employees essentially that

793
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,700
are doing all of that devops

794
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,080
and so that's and those are completely bottoms

795
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,480
up uh where you see the tools it's

796
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,060
kind of like hey i

797
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:31,320
have the new way to build agents it's

798
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,580
there i'm going to use it to create

799
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,720
levels of automation

800
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,100
that remove drudgery improve efficiency improve quality and

801
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,560
that ultimately is a skilling thing

802
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,420
which is sort of the big issue which

803
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:46,000
is uh and skilling is not mystical it's

804
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,040
just by doing right

805
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,240
so it's not like i go to a

806
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,520
class per se it's like the diffusion of

807
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,500
the tools uh and using the tools and

808
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,440
that i think is what's really going to

809
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,280
be happening and we're in a very interesting

810
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,960
moment empowering an

811
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,220
existing employee with these tools is so much

812
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:06,320
easier than hiring and mentoring and bringing up

813
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,060
the next generation so it feels like we're

814
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,820
in a little bit of an indigestion moment

815
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,160
at microsoft do you think who's going to

816
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,020
have my job in 30 or 40 years

817
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,200
if the company stays the same

818
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:23,020
size because given your technology first approach there's

819
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,100
really no reason to ever add another microsoft

820
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,800
employee at the pace this is going and

821
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,180
you haven't for four years so how you

822
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:31,860
may have swapped some

823
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,540
in and out and changed the texture of

824
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,180
it so how do you think about maybe

825
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,820
this next generation what

826
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,780
advice would you have for these college graduates

827
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:41,700
who maybe don't have an offer for microsoft

828
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:41,940
right

829
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,260
now and you used to spend a lot

830
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,840
of time on that building that group but

831
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,840
maybe you don't have that

832
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,020
luxury now do you think about it ever

833
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,120
i mean it's a great question i you

834
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,260
know there's a little bit of a

835
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,640
debate what happens to early in korea and

836
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,620
how is college recruiting i still am a

837
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,660
big believer in

838
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,440
college recruiting because at the end of the

839
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,960
day um this is going to change the

840
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,120
curve by which anyone

841
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,720
can pick up proficiency in a code base

842
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,640
let's just it takes sort of just regular

843
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,020
cs hiring uh what has

844
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:16,120
changed is perhaps for someone who comes in

845
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,200
new into a team and to be able

846
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,180
to ramp up thanks to

847
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:26,020
all of uh the markdowns the skills uh

848
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,920
the fact that i can go ask the

849
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,140
agent let me think about it

850
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:32,940
right it's like having an unbelievable mentor who's

851
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,520
getting you onboarded onto a code base faster

852
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,080
so in

853
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,360
some sense the productivity curve uh of a

854
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,100
college hire is going to be much steeper

855
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,060
than it ever before

856
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:45,320
so i think there might be a difference

857
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,840
in fact one of the things we're experimenting

858
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:47,540
with is a different

859
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:50,060
type of apprenticeship right which is you take

860
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:53,720
somebody who's an ic senior dev have like

861
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,400
a cohort

862
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:58,020
of college uh hires working with them because

863
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,740
it's a new way of working it's like

864
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,600
i remember like all

865
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,240
you know everybody who joined microsoft would say

866
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,480
go how did uh you know whatever um

867
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,980
cutler implement

868
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,940
malloc or what have you right he would

869
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:10,500
go try to read uh his code to

870
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,280
understand uh what great

871
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,440
craftsmanship looks like nowadays i think that great

872
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,540
craftsmanship uh comes by looking at even how

873
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:23,420
the 10x 100x engineers use ai to build

874
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:26,520
great quality products uh and that is what

875
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,580
these new college

876
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:30,140
guys will learn and learn faster and so

877
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,020
that's a beneficial thing for a company like

878
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:32,680
us because at

879
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,120
the end of the day you know until

880
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,500
we saw longevity or something we need people

881
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,900
to come into the workforce

882
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,840
be successful at microsoft so we are very

883
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,400
committed but we are also making sure that

884
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,340
the scopes of the

885
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:47,700
jobs make sense for what the aspirations of

886
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,080
people are going to be both who are

887
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,100
currently in the workforce

888
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,860
and people who are entering the workforce okay

889
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:55,900
on that note satya nadella thank you so

890
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,160
much
