1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,860
All right, welcome to 2026.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,400
So here's a section of our internal strategy

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,000
presentation

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,220
to talk to you about where we're going.

5
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,820
Okay, Evry is the only subscription that you

6
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:11,060
need

7
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,160
to stay at the edge of AI.

8
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,120
That's what we're building.

9
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,440
We have three main components of the business.

10
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,860
We do ideas, so that's a daily newsletter

11
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:18,380
about AI.

12
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,840
We've got apps, so we have four different

13
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:21,500
AI apps

14
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,660
that help you write with AI, help you

15
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:24,400
email with AI,

16
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,940
help you organize your files with AI,

17
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,360
does speech-to-text with AI.

18
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:30,380
Then we have training, so we do camps

19
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:30,780
and courses

20
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,420
where we teach you about how to use

21
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:32,780
these tools

22
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,840
like CloudCode or Codex in a really hands

23
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,160
-on way.

24
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,960
We do that all under one subscription.

25
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:40,940
And we build things in this loop where,

26
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:42,340
at the start of the loop, we live

27
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:42,740
in the future.

28
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,580
So we're all of us, it's this really

29
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:45,720
cool creative playground

30
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,940
where all of us are using all these

31
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:47,700
tools every day.

32
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,480
It's AI first in every way.

33
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,700
Writing code into a code editor, you're weird.

34
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:52,800
So we're living in the future.

35
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,640
We write what we see.

36
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:56,340
Writing, I think, is the soul of Evry,

37
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,520
and by articulating the future that you're living

38
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:58,760
in,

39
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,540
you bring that future into being

40
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:01,800
because you can now talk about it

41
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,980
with the people that you work with.

42
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,140
And so we write in order to make

43
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,120
that future visible

44
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,780
to each other and to the people who

45
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:08,200
read us.

46
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,920
And one of the consequences of that is

47
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:14,380
it makes it really easy to tell what's

48
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:14,680
missing,

49
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,860
and then we go build that.

50
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,300
And that becomes all the apps that we

51
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:17,520
make.

52
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,440
Quora, which is an email agent,

53
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,800
or Monologue, which is a speech-to-text

54
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,180
app.

55
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,200
These are all things that come from our

56
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,900
own needs.

57
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,400
And then we teach what works.

58
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,520
So we take all of that stuff,

59
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,820
and we teach it in camps and courses,

60
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,700
and we do big enterprise deals

61
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,040
where we do trainings to teach people how

62
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:34,420
to use AI.

63
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,160
So that's the quick background.

64
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,800
I actually did that whole background for the

65
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,140
team, too,

66
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,900
because after 10 days of vacation,

67
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:41,600
who knows what?

68
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,120
I barely remember what we do.

69
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,880
This is such a cool time

70
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,360
because 2025 was a huge breakout year for

71
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:47,600
us.

72
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,200
We hit $3 million in total revenue,

73
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,760
which is 3x growth.

74
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,120
We hit $2 million in ARR,

75
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,360
which is, again, 3x growth.

76
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,140
So that's amazing.

77
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:54,760
And it's just,

78
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,220
I've been running this business for six years,

79
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,480
so having a year like this,

80
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,120
it's just, we finally hit it.

81
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,620
I also feel like we really cemented our

82
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,060
status

83
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,940
where people think of us

84
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,140
and the vibe checks that we do.

85
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,260
Whenever a new model comes out

86
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,060
or a new product comes out,

87
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,280
they think, what is every's take,

88
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,280
which is really important to me.

89
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,160
And I think we've done a really good

90
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,380
job

91
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,560
of having these hands-on vibe checks

92
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,260
on the day it comes out

93
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,300
that tell us what you need to pay

94
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:15,580
attention

95
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,180
and what you don't.

96
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,640
And we also have four products in market.

97
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,360
And that's crazy.

98
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,000
We're a team of about 20 people

99
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,660
and we have four separate software products

100
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,100
that we run.

101
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,120
We also have our own custom CMS

102
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,960
that runs our website.

103
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,820
And we have a consulting business.

104
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,980
And that's just like crazy shape

105
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:31,900
for a business to have.

106
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:32,860
So I'm super proud of that.

107
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,900
And it sets us up for 2026

108
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,740
where I want to double down again.

109
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,720
Our current plan is to 3x our revenue

110
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:38,940
again.

111
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,300
So that would take us to about

112
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,440
6 million in ARR

113
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,640
and 10 million overall revenue,

114
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,720
which I think is really doable.

115
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,900
The growth from last year was purely organic.

116
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,240
So I think we have a very good

117
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,420
shot

118
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,340
to do this or better.

119
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,000
The next thing that we're going to do

120
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,080
is double down on a unified platform

121
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,760
and ecosystem.

122
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,040
So right now,

123
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:59,960
all the apps and the content,

124
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,420
they all live in separate silos.

125
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,040
And what we're doing in 2026

126
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,660
is we're going to build

127
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,940
a unified platform layer

128
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,280
where all the apps can talk to each

129
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:07,500
other.

130
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,180
And we build a centralized idea

131
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,960
of who you are and what you care

132
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,160
about

133
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,260
that makes all the apps better

134
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,320
and also makes the content

135
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,220
that we write better for you.

136
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,160
And then we're going to be fully agent

137
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:16,420
native.

138
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,460
This is something I'll talk about

139
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,340
a little bit more deeply later on.

140
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,840
But I think being agent native

141
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,000
is a new kind of software development

142
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,400
where apps that are agent native

143
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,700
are basically cloud code

144
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,760
and all the UI,

145
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,300
all the buttons.

146
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,000
It just kicks off an agent

147
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,720
to do all the work

148
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,280
instead of having code manually written

149
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,180
that gets executed.

150
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,080
And I really think

151
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,440
we're in a moment for that right now.

152
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,880
And we're moving all of our software

153
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,140
to be fully agent native

154
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,480
over the next couple months.

155
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,340
Here's what I told the team

156
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:44,180
about what it looks like

157
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,140
if things are working.

158
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,740
One is by the end of Q1,

159
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,460
if our products can talk to each other.

160
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,340
So we're going to have

161
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,120
Quora talking to Spiral.

162
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,440
When Quora wants to compose an email,

163
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,300
it can talk to Spiral,

164
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,200
which is our writing agent,

165
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,980
and ask it to write something great

166
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,200
or ask it for a writing style.

167
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,620
When Monologue,

168
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,140
which is our smart dictation app,

169
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,280
when you're using it,

170
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,300
it has a custom dictionary

171
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,400
to know what to transcribe

172
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,860
for hard to transcribe words.

173
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,720
And it'll be able to talk to Quora

174
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,260
to say,

175
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,400
okay, what are the kinds of words

176
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,240
that I should pre-fill

177
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,120
in the custom dictionary?

178
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,260
So we're going to have

179
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,480
the ability for all of our products

180
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,200
to talk to each other.

181
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,660
By the end of Q2,

182
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:17,640
we're going to have

183
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,720
a central concept

184
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,420
of who our users are

185
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,440
and what they care about.

186
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,760
So we're going to basically

187
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,960
gather all the context

188
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,000
from what you write,

189
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,080
what you say to your computer,

190
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:26,540
your emails,

191
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,180
and your files,

192
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,380
and build a view for you

193
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,600
of who you are

194
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,260
and what you care about

195
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,600
that goes into all of our apps,

196
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,480
goes into our content,

197
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,660
and that you can take with you

198
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,120
to chat to your cloud

199
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,200
to enhance the context

200
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,000
that they have about you.

201
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,920
By the end of Q3,

202
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:41,620
what I want to do

203
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,800
is use all of this

204
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,960
to make our content

205
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,020
more personalized and better.

206
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,200
It's very important to me

207
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,700
that we keep the human soul,

208
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,860
the human storytelling

209
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,460
as the core of every.

210
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,020
And I think it's clear

211
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,960
that it's weird

212
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:54,400
for everyone

213
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,260
to get the same newsletter

214
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:55,940
every day.

215
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,120
And if we really want

216
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,980
to keep you on the edge of AI,

217
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:58,920
we need to know

218
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,700
what you care about

219
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,400
and then tailor

220
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,260
what we tell you about

221
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,180
to what you care about.

222
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,960
And the last thing is,

223
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,240
by the end of Q4,

224
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:06,900
I think you'll be able

225
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,840
to see the ecosystem

226
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,980
not as an ecosystem

227
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,880
of apps and content,

228
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:10,920
but as an ecosystem

229
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,340
of agents

230
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,320
that all know about each other

231
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,400
and all collaborate really well

232
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,580
to help you get your work done.

233
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,640
I think a couple other things

234
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,440
that we really want to do,

235
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,360
we really want to be

236
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,040
the number one place

237
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:19,620
where people go

238
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,660
to learn, to code,

239
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,780
write, and design with AI.

240
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,840
I think we're on our way there,

241
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,600
but there's always more work to do.

242
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,160
I really also think

243
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,540
that the writing that we do,

244
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,140
right now the audience is humans,

245
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:30,860
but it needs to be

246
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,180
both humans and agents.

247
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,380
So a really good example

248
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,620
is we write a lot

249
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,700
about compound engineering,

250
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,200
which is our

251
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:36,980
engineering philosophy.

252
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,540
We have a CloudCode plugin

253
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,520
that teaches CloudCode

254
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,500
about compound engineering.

255
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,440
That's an example

256
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,460
of writing for both humans

257
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,040
and for agents.

258
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,220
I also want to be in a place

259
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,860
where by the end of the year,

260
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:47,740
we're all pushing

261
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,820
to each other's apps,

262
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,160
and that's already happening.

263
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,240
Everyone is committing code

264
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,100
to everyone else's apps,

265
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,780
but there's a lot

266
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,580
that needs to be done.

267
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,020
There's a lot of organizational stuff

268
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:57,520
to make sure

269
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,400
that everyone's repo

270
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,060
is set up well

271
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,220
to allow this kind of collaboration.

272
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,300
There's also a lot of etiquette

273
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,060
to be done about

274
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:04,540
when you should submit

275
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,360
a new feature

276
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,340
or bug fix to an app

277
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,080
and how to do it

278
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,260
to take the pressure off

279
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,200
or the work off

280
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,780
of the app GM

281
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,120
in order to allow them

282
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,960
to merge it.

283
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,220
So that's really interesting.

284
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,740
And the next level of that,

285
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,500
once we figure that out,

286
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,120
is allowing customers

287
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,120
to essentially write PRs

288
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,900
that we can really detail

289
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,460
bug reports

290
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,260
or feature specs

291
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:23,880
that we can then

292
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,700
one-shot with Cloud.

293
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:26,240
And I think that would be really cool.

294
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:26,720
So that's where

295
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,420
we're trying to go.

296
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,220
I want to talk for a little bit

297
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,340
about why this is even important.

298
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,240
Why are we doing this?

299
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,180
The world just changed recently.

300
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:34,860
Right now,

301
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,060
software agents are great.

302
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,160
That's crazy.

303
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,800
And the really interesting thing

304
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,760
is a couple companies,

305
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,140
Anthropic is a big one of them,

306
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:42,840
that made this bet

307
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,320
that if you make

308
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,180
a great software agent,

309
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,260
it becomes a really good

310
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:45,900
general agent.

311
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,600
And I think that's true.

312
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,160
And we're seeing that

313
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:47,700
with Cloud Code

314
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,720
and the Cloud Agent SDK.

315
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,620
And this has gigantic consequences

316
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,200
for software,

317
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:52,600
for writing,

318
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,040
for design,

319
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:53,740
for company building,

320
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,500
and for really

321
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,460
how we see ourselves

322
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,760
and our role

323
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,360
in the future.

324
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,120
And it is creating

325
00:06:59,120 --> 00:06:59,900
a tremendous amount

326
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,860
of anxiety and FOMO

327
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,320
and excitement

328
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,880
and just people feeling

329
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,640
like I can't keep up

330
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,040
and I don't want

331
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,560
to be left behind

332
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,000
and I don't know

333
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,420
how this is going

334
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,020
to change my job

335
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:06,820
and all that kind of stuff.

336
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,500
And there's so many good things,

337
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,540
but there's a real need

338
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,440
for people to actually

339
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,000
figure out

340
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,480
how do you live

341
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,140
a more creative,

342
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,020
more human future

343
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:14,880
with this technology?

344
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,280
I think that's probably

345
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,560
not the people

346
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,880
building the underlying models.

347
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,080
I think that's asking

348
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,180
an oven maker

349
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,340
how to bake a souffle.

350
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,800
It's people on the edge

351
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,540
who are doing work

352
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,500
that need to figure out

353
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,940
how these tools

354
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,860
fit into our lives

355
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,380
and I think

356
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,760
that's why we're here.

357
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,540
It's why we build

358
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,700
this bundled subscription.

359
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,180
If our goal is

360
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:33,820
to help people learn

361
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:34,800
to live and work with AI

362
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,740
in a more flourishing,

363
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,380
creative, better,

364
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,120
more human way,

365
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,680
that maps very cleanly

366
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,280
onto the bundle

367
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:39,860
that we're building.

368
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,260
So you need to spread the words.

369
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,180
You need to tell stories

370
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:43,980
about the future

371
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:44,540
that we see,

372
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,300
that we live in.

373
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,120
You need to build tools

374
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,780
that they'll use

375
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,160
and the tools that we sell

376
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:49,960
are tools that we build

377
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,560
for ourselves

378
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,460
and then we need

379
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,180
to teach them hands-on

380
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:52,700
and those are all

381
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,380
the components

382
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,120
of the company

383
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,660
that we're building

384
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,300
and I hope that

385
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,260
we have an opportunity

386
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,480
to be an archetypal

387
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,440
AI native company

388
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,220
and what that means

389
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:02,720
to me is

390
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,760
we figure out

391
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,300
for ourselves

392
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,060
how to build

393
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,420
and work

394
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:05,940
and live

395
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:06,880
in this new future

396
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,500
and then we become

397
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:08,960
an example

398
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,460
for other people

399
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:09,900
to follow

400
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,800
and in doing that

401
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,280
they subscribe

402
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,140
to read our ideas

403
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:12,660
and they use

404
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,160
the tool set

405
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:13,520
that we build

406
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,280
and all that kind of stuff

407
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,760
and my hope then

408
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,520
is that creates

409
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,280
the way that people

410
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,160
build and write

411
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,260
and think

412
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,120
in this new future

413
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,080
and that's really exciting

414
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,520
and I think

415
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,320
also very important

416
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:24,720
to me

417
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:25,900
and I think

418
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,800
we're in this moment

419
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,500
that I want to talk

420
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,240
about for one second

421
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,240
I've seen a lot

422
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,120
of technology waves

423
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,340
when everyone

424
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,440
first started in 2020

425
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,980
it was right before

426
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,360
the creator economy wave

427
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,220
and I was seeing

428
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,260
our numbers

429
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:39,900
just go up

430
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,340
and I was like

431
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,180
okay there's something

432
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,260
really special here

433
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:42,860
that's happening

434
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,920
we're growing super fast

435
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,560
I had that tingle feeling

436
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,260
and that's one of the reasons

437
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:46,840
why we really

438
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,140
went all in on the company

439
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,480
in 2022

440
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,100
one day

441
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:50,800
I think I'd be away

442
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,660
it was just GPT-3

443
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,160
but I was like

444
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,480
this is the next big thing

445
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,880
and after ChatGPT

446
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,240
we just really

447
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,520
focused the whole company

448
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,100
around AI

449
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,180
and that has really

450
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:01,720
paid off

451
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,740
and I am getting

452
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,760
that same feeling

453
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,780
right now

454
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,660
and that feeling

455
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,220
is about

456
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,140
what I call

457
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,440
agent native apps

458
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,340
which is basically

459
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,420
apps that are

460
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:12,800
cloud code

461
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,420
and a trench coat

462
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,880
there's a lot more detail

463
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,940
about what makes

464
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:16,640
something agent native

465
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,100
and how traditional software

466
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:18,640
fits into that

467
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,480
I think that cloud code

468
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,280
and trench coat metaphor

469
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:20,820
should tell you

470
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,680
most of what you need to know

471
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,060
and there's

472
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,400
a ginormous number

473
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,540
of implications for it

474
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:24,760
but

475
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,600
we're going all in

476
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,560
on that in 2026

477
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,060
and that means

478
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:29,920
the content that we write

479
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,740
the stuff that we build

480
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,580
all that stuff is

481
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,060
going to be really

482
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,820
focused around this

483
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,300
and yeah

484
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:35,720
that's it

485
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,920
that's our 2026 strategy

486
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,440
thanks for watching
