WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.860
All right, welcome to 2026.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.400
So here's a section of our internal strategy

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.000
presentation

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.220
to talk to you about where we're going.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.820
Okay, Evry is the only subscription that you

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:11.060
need

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:12.160
to stay at the edge of AI.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.120
That's what we're building.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.440
We have three main components of the business.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.860
We do ideas, so that's a daily newsletter

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:18.380
about AI.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.840
We've got apps, so we have four different

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:21.500
AI apps

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.660
that help you write with AI, help you

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:24.400
email with AI,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.940
help you organize your files with AI,

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.360
does speech-to-text with AI.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.380
Then we have training, so we do camps

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.780
and courses

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.420
where we teach you about how to use

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.780
these tools

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.840
like CloudCode or Codex in a really hands

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.160
-on way.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.960
We do that all under one subscription.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.940
And we build things in this loop where,

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.340
at the start of the loop, we live

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.740
in the future.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.580
So we're all of us, it's this really

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:45.720
cool creative playground

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.940
where all of us are using all these

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:47.700
tools every day.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.480
It's AI first in every way.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.700
Writing code into a code editor, you're weird.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:52.800
So we're living in the future.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.640
We write what we see.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.340
Writing, I think, is the soul of Evry,

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.520
and by articulating the future that you're living

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.760
in,

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.540
you bring that future into being

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.800
because you can now talk about it

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.980
with the people that you work with.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.140
And so we write in order to make

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.120
that future visible

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.780
to each other and to the people who

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:08.200
read us.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.920
And one of the consequences of that is

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.380
it makes it really easy to tell what's

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.680
missing,

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.860
and then we go build that.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.300
And that becomes all the apps that we

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.520
make.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.440
Quora, which is an email agent,

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.800
or Monologue, which is a speech-to-text

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:22.180
app.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.200
These are all things that come from our

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.900
own needs.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.400
And then we teach what works.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.520
So we take all of that stuff,

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.820
and we teach it in camps and courses,

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.700
and we do big enterprise deals

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.040
where we do trainings to teach people how

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.420
to use AI.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.160
So that's the quick background.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.800
I actually did that whole background for the

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.140
team, too,

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.900
because after 10 days of vacation,

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.600
who knows what?

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.120
I barely remember what we do.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.880
This is such a cool time

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.360
because 2025 was a huge breakout year for

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.600
us.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.200
We hit $3 million in total revenue,

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.760
which is 3x growth.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.120
We hit $2 million in ARR,

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.360
which is, again, 3x growth.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.140
So that's amazing.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.760
And it's just,

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.220
I've been running this business for six years,

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.480
so having a year like this,

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.120
it's just, we finally hit it.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.620
I also feel like we really cemented our

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.060
status

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.940
where people think of us

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.140
and the vibe checks that we do.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.260
Whenever a new model comes out

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.060
or a new product comes out,

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.280
they think, what is every's take,

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.280
which is really important to me.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.160
And I think we've done a really good

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.380
job

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.560
of having these hands-on vibe checks

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.260
on the day it comes out

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.300
that tell us what you need to pay

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.580
attention

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.180
and what you don't.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.640
And we also have four products in market.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:19.360
And that's crazy.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.000
We're a team of about 20 people

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.660
and we have four separate software products

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.100
that we run.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.120
We also have our own custom CMS

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.960
that runs our website.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.820
And we have a consulting business.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.980
And that's just like crazy shape

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:31.900
for a business to have.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:32.860
So I'm super proud of that.

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.900
And it sets us up for 2026

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.740
where I want to double down again.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.720
Our current plan is to 3x our revenue

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.940
again.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.300
So that would take us to about

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.440
6 million in ARR

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.640
and 10 million overall revenue,

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.720
which I think is really doable.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.900
The growth from last year was purely organic.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.240
So I think we have a very good

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.420
shot

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.340
to do this or better.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.000
The next thing that we're going to do

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.080
is double down on a unified platform

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.760
and ecosystem.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.040
So right now,

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.960
all the apps and the content,

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.420
they all live in separate silos.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.040
And what we're doing in 2026

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.660
is we're going to build

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:05.940
a unified platform layer

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.280
where all the apps can talk to each

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.500
other.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.180
And we build a centralized idea

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:10.960
of who you are and what you care

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:11.160
about

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.260
that makes all the apps better

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.320
and also makes the content

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.220
that we write better for you.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.160
And then we're going to be fully agent

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.420
native.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:17.460
This is something I'll talk about

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.340
a little bit more deeply later on.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.840
But I think being agent native

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.000
is a new kind of software development

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.400
where apps that are agent native

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.700
are basically cloud code

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:27.760
and all the UI,

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:28.300
all the buttons.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.000
It just kicks off an agent

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.720
to do all the work

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.280
instead of having code manually written

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.180
that gets executed.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.080
And I really think

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.440
we're in a moment for that right now.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.880
And we're moving all of our software

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.140
to be fully agent native

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.480
over the next couple months.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.340
Here's what I told the team

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.180
about what it looks like

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.140
if things are working.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.740
One is by the end of Q1,

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.460
if our products can talk to each other.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.340
So we're going to have

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.120
Quora talking to Spiral.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.440
When Quora wants to compose an email,

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.300
it can talk to Spiral,

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:55.200
which is our writing agent,

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:56.980
and ask it to write something great

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.200
or ask it for a writing style.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:59.620
When Monologue,

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.140
which is our smart dictation app,

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.280
when you're using it,

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.300
it has a custom dictionary

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.400
to know what to transcribe

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.860
for hard to transcribe words.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.720
And it'll be able to talk to Quora

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.260
to say,

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.400
okay, what are the kinds of words

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.240
that I should pre-fill

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.120
in the custom dictionary?

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.260
So we're going to have

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.480
the ability for all of our products

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.200
to talk to each other.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.660
By the end of Q2,

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.640
we're going to have

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.720
a central concept

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.420
of who our users are

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:21.440
and what they care about.

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.760
So we're going to basically

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:23.960
gather all the context

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.000
from what you write,

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.080
what you say to your computer,

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.540
your emails,

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.180
and your files,

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.380
and build a view for you

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.600
of who you are

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.260
and what you care about

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:33.600
that goes into all of our apps,

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:34.480
goes into our content,

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.660
and that you can take with you

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.120
to chat to your cloud

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.200
to enhance the context

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.000
that they have about you.

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:40.920
By the end of Q3,

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.620
what I want to do

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.800
is use all of this

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.960
to make our content

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.020
more personalized and better.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.200
It's very important to me

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.700
that we keep the human soul,

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:48.860
the human storytelling

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.460
as the core of every.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.020
And I think it's clear

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.960
that it's weird

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.400
for everyone

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:55.260
to get the same newsletter

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:55.940
every day.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.120
And if we really want

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.980
to keep you on the edge of AI,

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.920
we need to know

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:59.700
what you care about

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:00.400
and then tailor

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.260
what we tell you about

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.180
to what you care about.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.960
And the last thing is,

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.240
by the end of Q4,

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.900
I think you'll be able

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:07.840
to see the ecosystem

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:08.980
not as an ecosystem

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:09.880
of apps and content,

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.920
but as an ecosystem

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.340
of agents

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.320
that all know about each other

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.400
and all collaborate really well

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.580
to help you get your work done.

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.640
I think a couple other things

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:17.440
that we really want to do,

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.360
we really want to be

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.040
the number one place

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.620
where people go

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.660
to learn, to code,

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.780
write, and design with AI.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:23.840
I think we're on our way there,

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.600
but there's always more work to do.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.160
I really also think

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.540
that the writing that we do,

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.140
right now the audience is humans,

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.860
but it needs to be

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:32.180
both humans and agents.

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.380
So a really good example

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.620
is we write a lot

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:35.700
about compound engineering,

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:36.200
which is our

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.980
engineering philosophy.

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.540
We have a CloudCode plugin

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:39.520
that teaches CloudCode

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.500
about compound engineering.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:41.440
That's an example

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.460
of writing for both humans

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.040
and for agents.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.220
I also want to be in a place

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.860
where by the end of the year,

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:47.740
we're all pushing

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:48.820
to each other's apps,

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.160
and that's already happening.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.240
Everyone is committing code

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.100
to everyone else's apps,

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.780
but there's a lot

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:55.580
that needs to be done.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.020
There's a lot of organizational stuff

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.520
to make sure

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.400
that everyone's repo

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.060
is set up well

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:00.220
to allow this kind of collaboration.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.300
There's also a lot of etiquette

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:03.060
to be done about

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.540
when you should submit

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:05.360
a new feature

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.340
or bug fix to an app

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:07.080
and how to do it

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.260
to take the pressure off

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:09.200
or the work off

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.780
of the app GM

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.120
in order to allow them

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.960
to merge it.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.220
So that's really interesting.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.740
And the next level of that,

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:16.500
once we figure that out,

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.120
is allowing customers

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.120
to essentially write PRs

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.900
that we can really detail

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:22.460
bug reports

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:23.260
or feature specs

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.880
that we can then

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:24.700
one-shot with Cloud.

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:26.240
And I think that would be really cool.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.720
So that's where

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:27.420
we're trying to go.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.220
I want to talk for a little bit

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:30.340
about why this is even important.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:32.240
Why are we doing this?

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.180
The world just changed recently.

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:34.860
Right now,

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.060
software agents are great.

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:37.160
That's crazy.

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:38.800
And the really interesting thing

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.760
is a couple companies,

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.140
Anthropic is a big one of them,

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:42.840
that made this bet

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:43.320
that if you make

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.180
a great software agent,

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:45.260
it becomes a really good

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:45.900
general agent.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:46.600
And I think that's true.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:47.160
And we're seeing that

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:47.700
with Cloud Code

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:48.720
and the Cloud Agent SDK.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.620
And this has gigantic consequences

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:52.200
for software,

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:52.600
for writing,

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.040
for design,

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:53.740
for company building,

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:54.500
and for really

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:55.460
how we see ourselves

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:56.760
and our role

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:57.360
in the future.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.120
And it is creating

00:06:59.120 --> 00:06:59.900
a tremendous amount

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:00.860
of anxiety and FOMO

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:01.320
and excitement

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.880
and just people feeling

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.640
like I can't keep up

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:04.040
and I don't want

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.560
to be left behind

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.000
and I don't know

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.420
how this is going

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:06.020
to change my job

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.820
and all that kind of stuff.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.500
And there's so many good things,

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:09.540
but there's a real need

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:10.440
for people to actually

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.000
figure out

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:12.480
how do you live

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.140
a more creative,

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.020
more human future

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:14.880
with this technology?

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.280
I think that's probably

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.560
not the people

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:18.880
building the underlying models.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.080
I think that's asking

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.180
an oven maker

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:22.340
how to bake a souffle.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.800
It's people on the edge

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.540
who are doing work

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:25.500
that need to figure out

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.940
how these tools

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:27.860
fit into our lives

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:28.380
and I think

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:29.760
that's why we're here.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:30.540
It's why we build

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:31.700
this bundled subscription.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.180
If our goal is

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:33.820
to help people learn

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:34.800
to live and work with AI

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.740
in a more flourishing,

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:36.380
creative, better,

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:37.120
more human way,

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:38.680
that maps very cleanly

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.280
onto the bundle

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:39.860
that we're building.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.260
So you need to spread the words.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.180
You need to tell stories

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:43.980
about the future

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:44.540
that we see,

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:45.300
that we live in.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.120
You need to build tools

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:47.780
that they'll use

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:49.160
and the tools that we sell

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:49.960
are tools that we build

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:50.560
for ourselves

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:51.460
and then we need

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:52.180
to teach them hands-on

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:52.700
and those are all

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:53.380
the components

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:54.120
of the company

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:54.660
that we're building

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:56.300
and I hope that

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.260
we have an opportunity

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.480
to be an archetypal

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.440
AI native company

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.220
and what that means

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:02.720
to me is

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:03.760
we figure out

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:04.300
for ourselves

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.060
how to build

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:05.420
and work

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:05.940
and live

00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:06.880
in this new future

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:08.500
and then we become

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:08.960
an example

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.460
for other people

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:09.900
to follow

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:10.800
and in doing that

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:11.280
they subscribe

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.140
to read our ideas

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:12.660
and they use

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:13.160
the tool set

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:13.520
that we build

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:14.280
and all that kind of stuff

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.760
and my hope then

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:18.520
is that creates

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.280
the way that people

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.160
build and write

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.260
and think

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:22.120
in this new future

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.080
and that's really exciting

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:23.520
and I think

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.320
also very important

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:24.720
to me

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:25.900
and I think

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:26.800
we're in this moment

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:27.500
that I want to talk

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:28.240
about for one second

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.240
I've seen a lot

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.120
of technology waves

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:32.340
when everyone

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:33.440
first started in 2020

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.980
it was right before

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:36.360
the creator economy wave

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.220
and I was seeing

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:39.260
our numbers

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:39.900
just go up

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:40.340
and I was like

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:41.180
okay there's something

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:42.260
really special here

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:42.860
that's happening

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:43.920
we're growing super fast

00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.560
I had that tingle feeling

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.260
and that's one of the reasons

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:46.840
why we really

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.140
went all in on the company

00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:49.480
in 2022

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:50.100
one day

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:50.800
I think I'd be away

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:51.660
it was just GPT-3

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:52.160
but I was like

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.480
this is the next big thing

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.880
and after ChatGPT

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.240
we just really

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.520
focused the whole company

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:00.100
around AI

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:01.180
and that has really

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:01.720
paid off

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.740
and I am getting

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:04.760
that same feeling

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:05.780
right now

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:07.660
and that feeling

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:08.220
is about

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:09.140
what I call

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:10.440
agent native apps

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.340
which is basically

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:12.420
apps that are

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:12.800
cloud code

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.420
and a trench coat

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:14.880
there's a lot more detail

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:15.940
about what makes

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:16.640
something agent native

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.100
and how traditional software

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:18.640
fits into that

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:19.480
I think that cloud code

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.280
and trench coat metaphor

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:20.820
should tell you

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:21.680
most of what you need to know

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:22.060
and there's

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.400
a ginormous number

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.540
of implications for it

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:24.760
but

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:26.600
we're going all in

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.560
on that in 2026

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:29.060
and that means

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:29.920
the content that we write

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:30.740
the stuff that we build

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:31.580
all that stuff is

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.060
going to be really

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:33.820
focused around this

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:35.300
and yeah

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:35.720
that's it

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:36.920
that's our 2026 strategy

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:37.440
thanks for watching
