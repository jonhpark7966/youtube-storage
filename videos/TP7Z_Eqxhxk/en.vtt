00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
You would prefer the human race to endure,

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.820
right? You're hesitating. Yes? I don't know. I

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.700
would’ This is Peter Thiel. This is a

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.860
long hesitation. There's so many questions. Should the

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:22.140
human race survive? Yes. He's been a major

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.800
player in Silicon Valley for a long, long

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.440
time. I'm Peter Thiel. I build companies and

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.920
I support people who are building

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.260
new things from social networks to rocket ships.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.420
You might know him as the multi-billionaire

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.600
who

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.060
co-founded PayPal and Palantir. As Facebook's first

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.540
outside investor. The guy who funds out their

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.060
projects

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.100
like floating countries, private space travel and the

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.720
quest for immortality. Peter Thiel rejects the idea

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.720
that death is inevitable. He wants to transform

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.360
humanity. Transhumanism was this radical transformation

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.920
where your human natural body where your human

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.700
natural body gets transformed into an immortal body.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.500
We want you to be able to change

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.660
your heart and change your mind and change

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.440
your whole body.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.460
But he also wants to change something else.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.840
For decades, Thiel has schemed from the shadows

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.220
to reshape American politics.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.540
Tonight, I urge all of my fellow Americans

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.360
to stand up and vote for Donald Trump.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.360
He bankrolled Trump's first campaign. He turbocharged J

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.500
.D. Vance's career. Thiel openly questions the

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.480
democratic system. And he's declared that to him,

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.000
freedom is incompatible with democracy.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.020
His vision of an ideal society sounds more

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.400
like an oligarchy. A country ruled by a

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.640
few powerful rich

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.220
people. Or even just one. Today, his influence

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.200
is rapidly expanding across the world. From the

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.760
beginning of

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.320
his career, he's been building tools to rewire

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.020
how power works. Palantir, his brainchild, enables intelligence

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.560
agencies and militaries to anticipate their enemy's next

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.060
move before it's made. Maybe even your next

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.720
move, too.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.520
None of this happened by accident. Peter Thiel

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.520
plays the long game. He's patiently planned his

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.100
moves for

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.620
decades, always several steps ahead. So what does

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.140
Peter Thiel actually want?

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.300
What's his problem with democracy? And is there

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:29.080
an endgame?

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.920
This video is largely based on the research

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.600
collected in The Contrarian, Peter Thiel and

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.420
Silicon Valley's Pursuit of Power by Max Chavkin.

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.200
You'll find a link in the description.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.900
New York City, 2010. A TV show has

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.440
set up a night for Peter Thiel to

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.640
meet Gary Kasparov,

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.680
one of the greatest chess players of all

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.460
time. Thiel and Kasparov have met before and

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:59.260
get along well.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.580
They like chatting about politics, technology, and of

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.640
course, chess. Peter Thiel's a diehard chess fan.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.680
In fact, he's a national chess master. He's

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.120
admired the grandmaster Kasparov since he was a

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.620
teenager.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.660
And the respect is mutual. Kasparov admires Thiel's

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.340
intelligence and business sense.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.860
He is one of the probably most successful

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.440
entrepreneurs of his generation. He is very

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.760
aggressively investing. He looks for the future. Thiel's

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.980
legendary status in business is hard to

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.280
overstate. His companies have created technologies that have

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.180
changed the course of the modern world.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.600
And his influence helped define tech, an industry

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.160
that has produced millions of jobs and trillions

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.000
of dollars of wealth. That night, Kasparov and

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.360
Thiel hit up a chess club. Thiel plays

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.800
a game of

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.680
speed chess with the owner and wins. I'm

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.720
totally embarrassed.

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.120
Embarrassed as well. Kasparov suggests his chess skills

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.220
are probably why Thiel's such a successful

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.040
businessman and why he tends to hire chess

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.460
players for his companies. That's why he's hiring

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.760
chess

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.400
players, you know. Peter just told me the

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.120
story that one day he's the IPO for

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.620
Paypal. So he did a

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:09.460
simul for ten employees of Paypal. And sure,

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.080
Thiel is probably onto something. Chess skills transfer

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.600
well into the world of business. It's a

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.920
game of strategy, where it pays off to

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.080
think several moves

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.520
ahead. Skills that don't hurt in politics either.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.640
Sometime after this evening, Kasparov and Thiel drift

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.000
apart.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.180
Maybe the two don't have that much in

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.500
common after all. It's not just that the

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.820
Russian Kasparov is a

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.140
way better chess player. He's also one of

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.840
the world's most prominent pro-democracy activists.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.520
He's a major thorn in Putin's sight, tirelessly

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.260
campaigning for a freer Russia.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.580
So I'm fighting to restore democracy in my

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.920
country.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.240
Trump's potential victory could threaten not only democracy

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.860
in this country, but you know,

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.080
democracy worldwide. And Peter Thiel? Well, kind of

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.300
the opposite trajectory.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.720
Critics warn he's emerging as a major threat

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.360
to American democracy.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.200
Billionaires like Thiel reshaping politics is terrifying. Connecting

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.700
to airport Wi-Fi ranks way

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.760
lower on the scale. But having your data

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.360
floating around unprotected online is a threat you

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.940
can actually

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.080
do something about. This is where today's sponsor

did you actually just scan that QR code?

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:07.060
Peter Thiel is around 8 years old when

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.940
his family arrives in Swakopmund, a former German

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:10.620
colony on

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.220
Namibia's coast. He moved here with his parents

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.020
and brother after some years in Ohio. During

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.040
the 1970s,

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.740
the city is occupied by apartheid South Africa.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.980
At the time, it's a town clinging to

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:22.920
its German roots,

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.820
where Hitler's birthday is still celebrated and the

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.240
Nazi salute is a casual greeting for some.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.540
Peter's father, Klaus, takes an engineering job at

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.380
a uranium mine just outside town. The mine

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:34.520
is

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.300
controversial and shrouded in secrecy. According to international

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.560
law, South Africa isn't allowed to

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.060
mine here, but they go ahead anyway. Extracting

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.420
Namibia's uranium is part of South Africa's

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.960
nuclear weapons program. The regime is secretly developing

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:51.860
bombs to defend against a possible

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.800
Soviet attack and to protect the apartheid way

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.700
of life. According to a former British activist

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:58.100
group,

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.080
black laborers have worked at the mine under

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:02.900
dangerous conditions. Meanwhile, white families

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.960
like the Thiels enjoy a privileged life. Brand

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.860
new medical facilities, country club memberships,

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.780
kids in private school. Young Peter is reportedly

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.600
first put in a whites-only school in

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.260
Johannesburg,

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.680
then in a German language school in Swakopmund,

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.440
where their curriculum pushes a Christian nationalist

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:22.180
worldview and even paints white South Africans as

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.120
the real victims of the region. This is

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:25.280
where

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.480
Peter Thiel spends formative years. It's a world

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.160
where his family benefits from a white supremacist

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:31.540
regime,

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.460
where his father actively advances its military interests.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.260
A world where the founding belief is that

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:38.520
some

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.160
people are meant to rule, and the majority

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.240
must serve.

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.780
When Peter is 10, he and his family

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:51.340
return to the US. Peter is developing into

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:52.720
a classic nerd. He loves

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.980
sci-fi and fantasy, especially Lord of the

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.260
Rings. He's top of the class and becomes

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:58.000
one of the country's

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.920
top chess players under the age of 13.

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:01.900
It's not cool to be a nerd in

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.420
the 70s and 80s, so Peter is reportedly

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:09.320
bullied on the regular. But he knows he's

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:12.580
smart and going places. His chessboard has a

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:13.640
sticker that says

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.460
born to win. Peter wants the best for

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:18.380
himself, so he studies hard to get into

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:19.360
the top university.

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:21.920
At the time, Stanford is ranked number one

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.920
in the US. When he makes it there

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.220
in 1985, Stanford's a huge

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:30.140
letdown. Peter expects fellow overachievers, but finds a

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:32.540
party scene instead. He'd rather hit the

00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:34.820
books than the bong. And he's once again

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:37.620
teased for being a nerd. According to the

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:38.620
author Max Chafkin,

00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.880
many of the students he perceived as bullies

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:44.460
also identify as liberals. A connection that reportedly

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.860
sticks with him. We in fact asked Thiel

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:50.000
ourselves, but didn't get a response. Peter developed

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:50.380
into a

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:53.860
Reagan-supporting conservative. The campus itself feels far

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:56.180
too left-wing for him. Anti-Reagan and

00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:59.480
anti-Apartheid protests are prominent. And Peter starts

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.340
to clash with demonstrators. In The Contrarian,

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.920
Chafkin describes how classmates recall at least one

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.340
instance where Peter defended Apartheid as

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:10.520
economically sound. An allegation that Thiel has since

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:15.660
denied. At the time, some defenders of Apartheid

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:19.180
drew on libertarian arguments. Libertarians believe the best

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.000
society maximizes personal

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.860
and economic freedom while minimizing government control. They

00:09:24.860 --> 00:09:27.100
see free, unregulated markets as the

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.960
best way to allocate resources and drive innovation.

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:33.380
More radical libertarians value property rights and

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:37.060
free markets above basically anything else. Critics say

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:39.240
this leaves little room for values like social

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.880
justice, which are cast as secondary or even

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.800
incompatible with the libertarian definition of freedom.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.900
From that perspective, Apartheid could be rationalized. South

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.380
Africa's systematic denial

00:09:50.380 --> 00:09:52.480
of civil rights was simply the price to

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.460
pay for its higher level of wealth than

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:55.420
neighboring countries.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.460
By Peter's sophomore year, he's known on campus

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.200
as a hardcore libertarian. And though the 80s

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:01.360
see

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.340
students increasingly advocate for race and gender equality,

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.440
Stanford is not an entirely liberal

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.900
institution. It has a fair share of other

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.680
conservative and libertarian students and faculty members

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:15.200
during Peter's time there. Still, Shevkin describes Peter

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.500
feeling like he's in the minority and that

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:20.180
the dominant campus culture is hostile to people

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:22.720
like him. So he does what he'll keep

00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:23.400
doing throughout

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.080
his life. He builds a network of like

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.700
-minded men. The beginnings of a network that

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:29.500
will support him

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:32.200
throughout his career. What will later be known

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.160
as the so-called PayPal Mafia.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:38.600
With 11 other conservative men, Peter launches a

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.860
campus newspaper. The Stanford Review aims to stir

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:45.320
things up. It regularly criticizes campus culture from

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.680
a conservative perspective, with a famously

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.820
biting style. Throughout Peter's time at Stanford, a

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:54.020
few pieces especially stirred a pot. Shevkin found

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:54.140
a

00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:56.140
few examples in the Stanford archives that he

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:59.180
wasn't allowed to reproduce. One columnist claimed that

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:03.100
gay men engage in unnatural sex. Another complained

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:05.660
when Stanford considered adding non-white authors to

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:08.320
the Western culture course, arguing it signaled the

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:11.080
decline of the West. One whole issue was

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:11.700
devoted to

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.680
passionately defending a student accused of statutory rape,

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.800
who was later found guilty. Peter's not just

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.960
looking to provoke. He wants money, power, and

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.660
influence. And as its founding editor-in-chief,

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:26.120
the Stanford Review launches him into the public

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.760
intellectual he's known as today.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.700
The paper captures the attention of high-profile

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:32.860
conservatives, and a bit later Peter gets a

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:33.060
book

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:36.160
deal. The diversity myth is co-authored with

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.400
David Sachs, the student who wrote in defense

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.480
of an accused racist in the Stanford Review.

00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:43.680
Nowadays, Sachs is also an influential figure on

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.080
the American right. He currently serves the Trump

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.460
administration as the White House's AI and

00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:51.740
Crypto Czar. The book argues that universities are

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:53.740
dangerous breeding grounds for left-wing

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:58.460
intellectual conformity. That nowadays, real racism barely exists

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:00.520
in America. And that diversity

00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.220
initiatives pose a threat to Western culture. Sachs

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.140
and Teal have since apologized for some of

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:06.400
the more

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.780
controversial parts of the book. But these are

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.960
the same anti-woke sentiments that are winning

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:11.520
elections

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:23.620
today. Though Peter has plenty of gripes about

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:26.000
Stanford, he stays on and graduates from its

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.640
law school in 1992. He moves to New

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.500
York to begin his legal career. Only aiming

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:32.700
for the best, his goal

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:35.140
is to clerk for the Supreme Court. He's

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:37.700
got top grades, his own influential paper, and

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:38.540
connections to the

00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:41.680
right people. But it's not enough. I got

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.340
interviews with two justices. They normally interview eight

00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:47.660
people and select four as clerks. And I

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.800
missed it with both. And it felt like

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:50.960
it was the absolute end

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:53.620
of the world. Peter's not used to setbacks.

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.280
He plunges into what he later described as

00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:56.920
a quarter-life

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.320
crisis and briefly moves back in with his

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:02.420
parents. But back on the West Coast, Peter

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:03.680
proves he has a neck

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.500
for turning losses into big wins.

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:14.020
It's 1996. The tech industry is booming. Silicon

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:16.220
Valley is a place with endless possibilities,

00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:19.320
loads of investor money, and above all, unclear

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:22.440
rules. Peter wants in. Sure, he can't really

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:22.760
code,

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.220
but he can hand that off on someone

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.980
else. Peter studies up on hedge fund management,

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:27.740
raises some

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:30.940
capital and reinvents himself as an investor. At

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:33.520
the same time, he continues publishing anti-woke

00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:33.960
columns.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.920
One that claims indigenous people stay as anti

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:39.000
-western winds up in the Wall Street Journal.

00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:42.420
By chance, Peter meets the brilliant young cryptographer

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:44.960
Max Leftchin. Max is obsessed with

00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:48.560
Palm Pilots, clunky little handheld computers. At the

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.520
time, they're barely more than a calendar with

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:50.640
an

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.600
internet connection. Not all investors would listen to

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.980
a 20-something jabber away about Palm Pilots.

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:59.180
But Peter is not a typical investor. Max

00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:01.460
believes Palm Pilots will have way more potential

00:14:01.460 --> 00:14:01.900
if they

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:04.940
can be linked to businesses. If personal devices

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:06.720
were linked to a business's infrastructure,

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:09.240
a whole new world of users would open

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:12.680
up. Like connecting an individual directly with a

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:13.080
bank.

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:15.500
All someone needs to figure out is how

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:17.860
to build an encrypted network that can securely

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:18.360
link a

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:21.280
handheld device with a corporate system. And Max

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:23.800
believes he can do it. He is way

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:24.680
ahead of his time,

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:27.940
and Peter sees the potential immediately. He offers

00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:29.660
Max a quarter million dollar investment

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:32.200
the very next day. Peter will become known

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.740
for these big bets on inexperienced founders.

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:37.900
Bets that very often pay off.

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:42.240
On the surface, PayPal looks just like another

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.700
convenient way to pay. But in reality,

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:47.380
it was built on a radically libertarian vision.

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:50.980
Money moving freely, beyond government control.

00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:53.520
The same vision that would later drive the

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:56.060
crypto movement. And just like crypto,

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.700
that freedom quickly attracts the grey areas of

00:14:58.700 --> 00:14:59.280
the economy.

00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:02.640
PayPal's early growth comes from industries most banks

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.480
avoided, like gambling and NSFW stuff.

00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:08.840
Good thing Peter's been nurturing his political connections.

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:10.340
As Chafkin tells it,

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.440
Thiel worked to keep his business alive by

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:15.360
lobbying congress to keep online gambling legal and

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:15.800
to stop

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:18.140
PayPal from being treated as a national bank.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.620
We also asked Peter Thiel directly about this,

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.100
but didn't get a response either.

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:27.480
Ecommerce is exploding in popularity. There's high demand

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.360
for a tool that can simplify online

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.000
transaction. And Max and Peter aren't the only

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.520
ones working on a solution. PayPal isn't even

00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:34.960
the only

00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:37.740
online payment startup in the same building. There's

00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:40.420
a very similar company on the same floor.

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:41.480
It's called

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.680
x.com and its founder has a lot

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:46.440
in common with Peter. Most notably, Elon Musk

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:47.640
is also an enterprising

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:50.780
immigrant with roots in South Africa. Like Peter,

00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:53.380
he also shows little regard for traditional rules

00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:53.580
of

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:56.380
the banking industry. Playing by every rule only

00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:58.660
slows down growth. But for a while, they

00:15:58.660 --> 00:15:59.020
have no

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:01.680
idea what each other's companies are for. Until

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.840
a PayPal employee finds a business plan for

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:04.700
x.com in a

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.920
dumpster. And then it becomes impossible to ignore

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.100
each other. They become two of the biggest

00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:10.640
fish in

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:14.040
the sea of online payments. PayPal's growing rapidly,

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.880
but at the same time bleeding funds.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.560
Every new user gets a cash bonus, most

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.180
transactions rack up fees, and servers are expensive.

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:22.200
Worse,

00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:25.080
the anonymity that makes PayPal attractive also opens

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:27.400
the door to credit card fraud. And PayPal

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:27.640
would

00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:30.820
have to refund the victim's stolen money. Max

00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:33.080
left in response by building an anti-fraud

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:33.760
system called

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:37.440
Igor. Software that flags suspicious patterns and blocks

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.580
scam transactions. All the while,

00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:43.300
user anonymity is still preserved. Igor successfully curbs

00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.740
fraud by half of what it was. The

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:46.400
FBI takes

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.700
interest in the technology and starts using the

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:50.520
software to catch money launderers.

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:55.180
Still, PayPal isn't profitable. Peter thinks he knows

00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:57.980
the answer. It has to become a monopoly.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.720
Eliminate competitors, dominate the market, and set the

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:02.040
rules.

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.060
As Peter often puts it. Competition is for

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:06.800
losers. Competition is for losers.

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:09.940
Competition is for losers. This strategy will come

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:11.740
to define Peter Thiel's success.

00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:14.600
He'll outline it in the business bestselling book

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.480
Zero to One. And it will become a

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:16.780
guiding

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:19.180
principle in the tech industry. What I think

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:21.920
everybody who is a founder or entrepreneur should

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.400
aim to do is build a monopoly. And

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:28.560
all the great companies that people have built

00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:29.940
are monopolies of one

00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:32.360
sort or another. By 2000, the online payment

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:35.200
space has grown more competitive. And PayPal is

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:35.400
still

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.240
operating at a loss. Elon suggests a merger.

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.560
And Peter agrees. Uniting is their best chance

00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:42.280
for survival.

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.080
According to The Contrarian, they clash from the

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:48.380
start. Over the name. Over the software.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.420
Elon becomes CEO because he's a bigger shareholder.

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:53.860
But Peter allegedly can't stand his leadership.

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:56.840
He's set to think Elon's a reckless egomaniac.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.860
And Elon is set to think Peter's a

00:17:58.860 --> 00:17:59.720
sociopath who

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.440
only cares about money. Their battles stall the

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:05.400
company's growth. So Thiel decides to end them.

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.100
Elon goes on his honeymoon, leaving the CEO

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:10.640
position undefended. And in an elegant,

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:14.560
calculated move, Peter captures it. Levchin and others

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.340
loyal to Thiel start voicing their

00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:19.120
gripes about Musk. They manage to convince enough

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:21.500
board members to oust Musk and to insert

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:22.100
Thiel as

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:25.800
temporary CEO. A position he'll keep. It won't

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.060
be Thiel's last tactical takedown.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:36.100
As CEO of PayPal, Peter Thiel is on

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:39.000
a whole new playing field. In 2002, he

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.340
secures a landmark deal.

00:18:40.340 --> 00:18:44.040
eBay acquires PayPal for 1.5 billion dollars.

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:47.180
Thiel becomes a multi-millionaire at 35 years

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:47.540
old,

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.300
walking away with at least 55 million dollars

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:52.660
from the deal. Now he has the capital

00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:53.580
and credibility

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:57.060
to pursue his wildest dreams. The day he

00:18:57.060 --> 00:18:58.740
signs the deal is the day he also

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:00.040
steps down as CEO.

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.400
PayPal was just a stepping stone. Now he's

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.400
ready to move on to bigger and bolder

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.860
projects. And to

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:08.820
live the high life as a very rich

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:11.980
person. He buys a silver Ferrari and fancy

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:13.660
apartments. Now the

00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:15.680
formerly bullied kid is the life of the

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.380
party. More and more people want to be

00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:20.120
in his orbit. Thiel's

00:19:20.120 --> 00:19:25.260
personal trajectory is skyrocketing. But the country is

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:25.900
spiraling.

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.500
In the wake of 9-11, Americans also

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:34.660
face a recession, an unpopular war and widespread

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:35.260
trauma.

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:39.920
Thiel is anxious too. He's increasingly concerned with

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.660
the threat of religious terrorism.

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.880
He finds the Bush administration isn't tough enough

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:48.600
on Islam. His politics seem to shift. At

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:52.100
Stanford he wrote fiery libertarian essays railing against

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:55.000
government power. Now he's arguing the

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.760
opposite, that the US must use extra judicial

00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:00.600
methods to catch terrorists. As he put it,

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.800
outside the checks and balances of representative democracy

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.920
as described in high school textbooks.

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.880
For Thiel, the trade-off is clear. The

00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:13.300
West must compromise. More security, less freedom. And

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:13.400
he

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:16.160
sees a business opportunity in it. What if

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:18.740
Igor, the software Max Levchin built to catch

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:19.300
fraudsters,

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.680
could be retooled to catch terrorists? Wouldn't the

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:26.420
CIA be interested? In 2003, Thiel gets a

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:27.080
team to start

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.540
working on it right away. They'll call the

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:33.780
company Palantir. In The Lord of the Rings,

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:36.420
a Palantir is a mythical stone that sees

00:20:36.420 --> 00:20:39.760
and communicates across far distances. Sauron,

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:42.100
the evil character who seeks to dominate Middle

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:44.760
-earth, uses a Palantir to spy on enemies

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:45.980
and conspire with

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:57.920
allies. Basically, Thiel is offering Sauron's power to

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:00.820
anyone who can afford it. Palantir's promise?

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:04.480
Use network analysis to find unforeseen patterns in

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:07.860
vast troughs of data. This is especially interesting

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:10.920
to US intelligence agencies who had collected information

00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:13.040
on Al-Qaeda conspirators but failed

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.300
to see the connections till after the attack.

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.220
In the early years, many users are disappointed

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:18.500
with

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:21.720
Palantir's service. But their timing is excellent with

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:24.700
everyone terrified of another attack. And Thiel's

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.920
chosen CEO is excellent at raising money. His

00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:30.580
name is Alex Karp. He's another former Stanford

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:31.300
classmate.

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:34.120
When Osama Bin Laden is captured and killed,

00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:36.780
rumors circulate that Palantir was used to find

00:21:36.780 --> 00:21:37.040
him.

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:40.700
Public interest in the company skyrockets. Based on

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.300
what's known today about Palantir's

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:45.140
abilities at the time, any meaningful involvement is

00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:48.020
questionable. When media outlets ask Alex

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:50.280
Karp about that rumor, he's careful not to

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:53.380
confirm or deny involvement. He tends to dodge

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:53.880
the question

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.300
with a smile and imply that some connection

00:21:56.300 --> 00:22:00.380
is there. Did your company help to track

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:00.920
and kill

00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:03.620
Osama Bin Laden?

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:05.960
When you open the paper and look in

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:09.480
the news about these kinds of things, there's

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:12.040
a two-thirds chance,

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:14.940
depending on the country involved, that somehow my

00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:15.940
company was involved.

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:19.920
One media outlet isn't buying the hype. A

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:23.480
gossipy blog called Gawker. According to Max Chafkin,

00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:26.340
Gawker's Silicon Valley page reports no real link

00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.440
between Palantir and the Bin Laden raid,

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.340
and suggests the company spread the rumor just

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:34.480
to boost sales. Valleyweg is known for roasting

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:34.700
the

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:37.040
tech industry back when most news outlets tend

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:39.640
to sing its praises. And a favorite target

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:40.320
of Gawker's

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:43.700
gossip and mockery is Peter Thiel. Thiel will

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:45.200
take care of Gawker later.

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:49.460
Beyond founding Palantir, Thiel spends the 2000s turning

00:22:49.460 --> 00:22:51.040
tech startups into giants.

00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:53.140
I was the sort of first angel investor

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:55.660
in Facebook in the summer of 2004. The

00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:56.360
business was already

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.660
tracking quite well. They only needed money to

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:00.460
buy more computers, so I think that was

00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:00.840
always sort of

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:01.740
a promising sign.

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:05.060
In 2004, he becomes Facebook's first big investor.

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:07.100
Thiel not only funds the company,

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:10.660
but becomes Zuckerberg's mentor. Now, Zuckerberg is one

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:12.840
of the richest people alive. And Thiel's

00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:16.680
investment will net him about $400 million. Thiel

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:18.880
doesn't stop there. Through his network,

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:23.040
he backs Airbnb, Spotify, SpaceX, and later OpenAI.

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.180
In 2007, Thiel seems to have spotted the

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:29.240
financial crisis early. He bets against the US

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:31.360
housing market. The gamble pays off.

00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:34.440
A 60% return in just six months.

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:37.700
Banks will collapse, and around 9 million Americans

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:38.000
will

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.760
lose their jobs. But for Thiel, it's cause

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.860
for celebration. According to Chavkin, he flies his

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:46.500
stuff to Maui, with unlimited tabs for food,

00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:50.160
booze, massages, and surfing. We asked Peter Thiel

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:50.520
if this

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.860
is true, but he didn't answer. But Thiel's

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:56.660
golden run doesn't last. After a string of

00:23:56.660 --> 00:23:57.700
bad investments and

00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:00.480
mass redemptions, his hedge fund suffers huge losses

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:04.000
and all but collapses. By 2011, he will

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.120
have lost nearly two-thirds of his clients'

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:09.240
money. The crisis seems to make Thiel more

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.180
cynical. In 2009,

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.680
he writes that he still believes in libertarian

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:16.600
principles, but no longer in democracy.

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:19.900
I no longer believe that freedom and democracy

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:23.500
are compatible, he declares. He argues that America

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:23.760
has

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:26.640
been in decline since the 1920s, when women

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.160
gained the right to vote, and when the

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:28.800
Great Depression

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:32.280
created mass unemployment. In his view, women and

00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:35.140
poor people are especially hostile to libertarian

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:38.280
policies. Their ability to vote stands in the

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:40.180
way of his ideal society.

00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:44.200
The essay makes waves. Gawker Media calls him

00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:47.300
a loopy libertarian, ridiculing him for wishing women

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:50.060
couldn't vote. Thiel later clarifies it's not that

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:52.020
he wants to take one class of voters'

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:52.660
rights away.

00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:55.860
The problem is that Americans, in general, won't

00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:57.560
vote for libertarian policies.

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:01.720
So, better to do away with democracy altogether?

00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:07.600
Meanwhile, Gawker Media gleefully reports Thiel's investment failures.

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:10.480
They claim he exaggerates his net worth and

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:12.160
make fun of his hypocrisies.

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:14.940
Gawker reported on a lot of important topics

00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:16.700
other media outlets wouldn't touch

00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:18.940
till much later, like the crimes of Harvey

00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:20.600
Weinstein and Jeffrey Epstein.

00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:23.340
But they also posted a lot of arguably

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:24.400
cruel gossip.

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:28.040
In 2007, they outed Thiel's sexual orientation with

00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:28.800
a post titled,

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:32.340
Peter Thiel is totally gay people. Peter Thiel's

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:34.460
sexuality was an open secret at the time,

00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:36.380
but he didn't seem to want it reported.

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:39.560
His outing was clearly a violation of privacy.

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:43.060
According to The Contrarian, Thiel sees Gawker's coverage

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:44.680
as damaging to his business.

00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:47.620
And plenty of other people have grudges against

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:48.120
the side,

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.900
so Thiel quietly funds a team of lawyers

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:52.300
to take up their cases.

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:56.000
The decisive moment comes in 2012, when Gawker

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.040
publishes a leaked

00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:00.080
sex tape of the wrestler Hulk Hogan. Hogan

00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:01.620
sues, and Thiel secretly

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:03.520
bankrolls the fight with $10 million.

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:12.360
The stage is set for a major courtroom

00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:12.780
battle.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:16.240
Hulk Hogan, former professional wrestler turned reality star,

00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:18.740
is taking on media website Gawker.

00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.860
Gawker is hit with just over $140 million

00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:24.980
in damages and files for bankruptcy in 2016.

00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:28.380
Gawker Media is no more. And Thiel is

00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:29.260
proud of his win,

00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:32.060
calling it the most philanthropic thing he's ever

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:32.360
done.

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.200
In an interview, he compares the journalists behind

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.660
the company to terrorists.

00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.780
The world learned that it's dangerous to mess

00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:40.720
with Peter Thiel.

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:43.720
Reporters Without Borders called his feet a serious

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.600
threat on freedom of the press.

00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:48.300
Critics argue that this set a precedent for

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:49.500
wealthy individuals to

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:52.460
weaponize the courts and bury media that criticizes

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:52.780
them.

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:56.660
But Peter Thiel is just getting started.

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:03.960
It's often said that two things in life

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:05.800
are certain, death and taxes.

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:07.940
Well, Peter Thiel disagrees.

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:11.280
With others see as inevitabilities, Thiel sees as

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:12.660
problems to be solved.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.500
He famously funds biotech companies pursuing life extension.

00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:19.800
His hatred of taxes has some poor resources

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:23.440
into anti-tax political actions and also seasteading.

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:26.540
Man-made island nations free from income tax

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:27.960
and governmental regulations.

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:31.500
A floating libertarian utopia where he can escape

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.200
systems he finds oppressive.

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:35.280
An idea he has since abandoned.

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:38.320
He looks into other exit plans, like a

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.340
bunker in New Zealand, which he also later

00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:40.720
drops.

00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:43.420
And the chance for humanity to reach Mars.

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.040
This becomes Peter Thiel's pattern.

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:47.460
Seeking escape.

00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:50.700
Escape from rules that govern everyone else.

00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:57.500
But escape on Peter Thiel's scale doesn't come

00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:57.960
easily.

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:02.920
Immortality research and space exploration require massive resources.

00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:06.260
Changing tax laws requires massive influence.

00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:08.140
Fortunately for Thiel,

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:10.540
his wealth and influence have grown enormously.

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:13.940
So he can attempt to reshape politics to

00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:15.660
enable his search for escape.

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:19.780
In 2007, he does something unusual for Silicon

00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:20.640
Valley entrepreneurs.

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:23.540
He starts funding presidential candidates.

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:26.580
His first big bet is the libertarian Ron

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:26.920
Paul.

00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:29.900
A longshot candidate for presidency, but a politician

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:31.180
with a passionate base.

00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:34.220
Like Thiel, Paul is an advocate for extreme

00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:35.520
free market capitalism.

00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:38.440
They're also both skeptical of climate change to

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:39.360
different degrees.

00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:42.600
Ron Paul doesn't win the 2008 presidency.

00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:43.720
Obama does.

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:46.440
In 2012, Ron Paul runs again.

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.880
And this time, Thiel is his biggest donor

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:49.760
by a longshot.

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:52.500
Thiel wasn't really banking on Paul's win.

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:54.680
Instead, he was thinking ahead.

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:57.180
In an interview with the magazine Slate from

00:28:57.180 --> 00:29:00.080
2012, Thiel says he was really campaigning for

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:00.840
2016.

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:03.880
Building up a strong libertarian base.

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.860
Thiel seems to want a candidate who will

00:29:08.860 --> 00:29:10.660
ensure his wealth will be protected.

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.520
One who will grant more power to the

00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:14.280
tech industry.

00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:16.940
And one who shares his view that America

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:19.040
is in decline and needs a strong man

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:20.220
to become great again.

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:23.360
When Trump is revealed as the best candidate

00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:24.700
to promote those aims,

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:27.920
Thiel donates $1.25 million to his campaign.

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:31.340
In 2016, Thiel takes the stage at the

00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:33.720
Republican National Convention during primetime.

00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:37.080
Tonight, I urge all of my fellow Americans

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:39.920
to stand up and vote for Donald Trump.

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:42.440
Thiel campaigns for Trump as if his views

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:43.740
represented Silicon Valley.

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:46.540
But at the time, Trump is deeply unpopular

00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:47.080
in tech.

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:49.300
Of the top tech companies in the Valley,

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:52.500
not a single CEO donates to Trump's 2016

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:53.060
campaign.

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:55.640
And Thiel's support of Trump makes him somewhat

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:56.520
of a pariah.

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.620
According to the contrarian, friends cut ties with

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:01.760
him or refuse to discuss politics.

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:03.500
Thiel is unbothered.

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:05.780
They'll change their tune soon enough.

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:08.520
Besides, he's starting to lean into his image

00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.440
as the Silicon Valley supervillain.

00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:12.100
He reportedly once said,

00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:15.340
I'd rather be seen as evil than incompetent.

00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:18.240
When Trump shocks the world by winning, Thiel

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.720
is part of the transition team.

00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:21.940
His role is to appoint people who will

00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:24.340
disrupt regulatory bodies like the Federal Trade

00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:26.460
Commission and the Food and Drug Administration.

00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:29.340
A dream job for Thiel, who's railed against

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:31.360
governmental regulation for decades.

00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:34.920
Thiel reportedly suggests 150 names to Trump.

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:37.560
According to Max Shevkin, his list includes, to

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:39.480
no surprise, ultra-libertarians.

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.780
But also very controversial figures.

00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:44.920
Fringe people from his growing network of far

00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:45.940
-right reactionaries.

00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:48.440
Trump only approves a handful of them.

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:51.340
The least controversial suggestions that Thiel makes.

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:54.400
So Thiel's first attempt at capturing the White

00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.640
House seems to have failed.

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:58.560
Politically, Thiel retreats to the background for a

00:30:58.560 --> 00:30:58.760
bit.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000
He and his partner have their first child

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.820
and he seems to focus on family life

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:03.320
for a while.

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:06.820
But the background is where Peter Thiel thrives

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:07.380
the most.

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:11.960
Outside of politics, Thiel's businesses are skyrocketing.

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:13.760
Especially Palantir.

00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:17.540
During COVID, Palantir wins government contracts to analyze

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:18.380
pandemic data,

00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:20.340
tracking infections and vaccines.

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:23.900
In 2025, Business Insider reports that under the

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:25.060
second Trump administration,

00:31:25.300 --> 00:31:27.760
ICE will use Palantir to track down immigrants

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.040
who overstate their visas.

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:32.780
Palantir's involvement has only intensified under Trump and

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:34.780
has been instrumental for over a decade

00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:36.740
since Obama's second administration.

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:40.580
The Guardian reports in 2025 that Palantir provides

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:42.340
ICE with tools that help their agents

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:45.940
fulfill Trump's aggressive deportation quotas using a vast

00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:46.740
data network.

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:49.780
It includes government records such as text data

00:31:49.780 --> 00:31:51.840
from the IRS and private databases

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:54.180
like location history from cell phone records.

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:58.260
Now Palantir also incorporates facial recognition data from

00:31:58.260 --> 00:31:59.100
Clearview AI,

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:01.800
another startup where Peter Thiel is the first

00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:02.300
investor.

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:04.640
The pattern is clear.

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:07.020
Palantir thrives in chaos.

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:09.740
And chaos is only ramping up.

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:16.520
What looks like a political setback with Trump

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:18.620
may just be Thiel's chance to plan his

00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:19.280
next move.

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:22.500
Thiel won't back Trump's second campaign, but he

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.420
will build up another politician.

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:27.240
We're effectively run in this country via the

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:29.500
Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs,

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:31.660
by a bunch of childless cat ladies who

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:33.380
are miserable at their own lives and the

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:34.400
choices that they've made.

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:39.280
Thiel injects J.D. Vance's primary campaign with

00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:40.080
$15 million.

00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:43.360
Vance is now Vice President of the United

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:43.980
States.

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:47.080
Thiel and Vance's relationship didn't come out of

00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:47.440
nowhere.

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:50.200
Vance worked at one of Thiel's companies and

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:52.940
Thiel became his mentor, as Vance himself says.

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:55.480
And it was also Thiel who brought J

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:57.360
.D. Vance and Donald Trump together.

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:01.320
After Trump is elected as president again in

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:04.180
2024, several members of the tech elite rally

00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:04.880
behind him.

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:07.360
There's Elon Musk, who is against Trump in

00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:10.300
2016 and becomes his most visible supporter in

00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:10.900
2024.

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:14.460
There's Mark Zuckerberg, who abolishes fact-checkers at

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:16.600
Meta less than two weeks before Trump takes

00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:17.000
office.

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:19.860
And there's Sundar Pekai, the CEO of Google,

00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:22.520
who donates $1 million to Trump just before

00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:23.260
inauguration.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.900
At the inauguration of Trump's second presidency in

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:30.600
January 2025, major tech CEOs are clearly visible

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:31.460
in the front row.

00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:41.980
Instead, he watches Palantir's stock skyrocket and topping

00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:43.820
the market for much of 2025.

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.480
The surge is in part fueled by government

00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:47.140
contracts.

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:51.900
Palantir has been hired by Israeli forces allegedly

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:55.360
to enable AI power targeting of Palestinians, which

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:57.880
the company denies, and by Ukraine in its

00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:58.920
war against Russia.

00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:02.780
These and other contracts not only boost Palantir's

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:05.760
profits, they also give the company access to

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:07.420
extremely sensitive data.

00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:10.940
Few assets carry more power or more potential

00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:11.580
for harm.

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:14.200
So, who decides how it's used?

00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:18.620
We reached out to Peter Thiel as well

00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:20.220
as Palantir because we had a lot of

00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:20.700
questions.

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.140
Unfortunately, none of them were answered.

00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:28.240
In 2012, Peter Thiel said,

00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:30.620
One of the things I like about technology

00:34:30.620 --> 00:34:33.420
is that when technology is unregulated, you can

00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:35.900
change the world without getting approval from other

00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:36.340
people.

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:39.260
At its best, it's not subject to democratic

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:42.560
control and not subject to the majority, which

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:44.940
I think is often hostile to change.

00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:47.980
A recent venture Thiel backed is called Erebor,

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:50.340
a crypto bank named after the mountain in

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:52.700
The Hobbit where a murderous dragon hordes treasure.

00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:55.340
And now Trump is pushing one of Thiel's

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:58.840
wilder ideas, low-tax freedom cities where corporations

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:00.960
can operate without federal regulations.

00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:04.400
We'll actually build new cities in our country

00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:04.940
again.

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:09.220
These freedom cities will reopen the frontier, reignite

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:10.540
American imagination.

00:35:10.940 --> 00:35:13.040
Freedom cities aren't just for making a lot

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:13.500
of money.

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:16.080
The goal is also to conduct research without

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:17.240
governmental approval.

00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:21.940
One such place already exists, Prospera in Honduras.

00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:24.560
You already know who helped fund it.

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:28.040
The libertarian utopia Peter Thiel dreams of no

00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:30.380
longer needs Mars or the open ocean.

00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:33.200
It's being built right in America.
