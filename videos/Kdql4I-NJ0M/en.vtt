00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
What virtually everybody finds, including Elon Musk, is

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.620
the real world is just really, really big

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.100
and really, really messy.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.500
The AI thing is so interesting, right? Because

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.440
from a technology perspective, it feels like you

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.320
can build products pretty immediately that are going

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.600
to win.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.280
Our entire way of doing everything as humans,

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.640
we think is going to change. We reinvented

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.800
the computer and the new computer is far

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.660
better than the one that we have been

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.640
building on for the last 50 or so

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:23.960
years.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:25.860
The purpose of building the dominant venture brand

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.420
was precisely to be able to have the

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.920
companies be able to borrow that at the

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:29.940
most critical points of their development.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.440
So that the companies can kind of use

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.040
our force in the world as a slingshot

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.220
to basically build their own force.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.300
You cannot join the firm unless you sign

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.360
the culture document.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.720
If you had to pick a thing, what

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.420
are you compounding?

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.160
Reputation.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.220
We have a very special guest, Packy McCormick,

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.300
who just wrote an excellent profile of A6

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.760
and Z. Packy, thanks for coming on the

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:51.040
podcast.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.180
Thanks for having me.

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:53.900
Packy, I want to start by saying thank

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.880
you for the amazing piece. Like, it's just

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.520
like incredible. Like, absolutely incredible.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.040
So we just really appreciate all the work

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.560
that you put into it because that was

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.900
a big one.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.460
Thank you. I mean, I appreciate being able

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:05.700
to tell the story. It's such a cool

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.880
one. And I appreciate getting to work with

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:09.340
you guys on it.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.880
Everybody, welcome to the Ben and Mark Show,

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.900
first of 2026. And we're now getting into

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.640
how the media ecosystem has changed.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.900
We talked about this great, great Tad Friend

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.300
profile in The New Yorker in 2015 that

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.100
I referenced in the piece that I wrote

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.620
on A16Z this past week, saying that that

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.500
kind of kicked off.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.160
It was the last kind of point in

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.100
an era where journalism cared about free speech.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.120
I think Mark will do a better job

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.840
kind of summarizing what happened over the past

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.160
decade.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.200
Now we're at the end of that point.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.140
And I was asking, you know, to what

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.840
extent Mark thinks that he and kind of

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.580
a few people who stood up against this

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.880
actually kind of shifted back to this anarchic

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.060
or liberated view of the press or relationship

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.980
with the media that we have now.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.240
Yeah. And I was just saying, I think

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.780
you could describe what's happening kind of going

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.940
forward, the information environment being, you know, you

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:56.820
could use kind of three words.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.460
You could say uncontrolled is maybe the neutral

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.820
word. You could say anarchic is the negative

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.680
word. You could say liberated is the positive

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.900
word, you know, in terms of freedom of

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.400
speech, freedom of thought, you know, and I

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.780
would say at least in the U.S.,

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:07.880
I think generally on the Internet.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.240
And then, you know, we can talk about

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.260
what other countries are doing, but at least

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.240
in the U.S., you know, we're clearly

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.480
entering a much more free speech world.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.120
So I have to start by saying, like,

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.540
I don't think I should claim any moral

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.680
heroism at all here, like at all, because,

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.280
you know, I, you know, I mean, I

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.440
have my own version of my own story

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.080
going all the way back to, I turned

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.260
down one of my claims to, I turned

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.540
down the opportunity at the time in 1993

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.360
to implement censorship in the web browser, you

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.680
know, which would have been a completely different

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.040
and, you know, very dystopian world.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.180
So I don't know, maybe I get a

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.920
little bit of credit for that. But, you

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.100
know, I think for the last decade, like

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.180
I was kind of on the same ride

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.860
as everybody else.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.220
And, you know, we, you know, we, you

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.320
know, I've been on the, I've been on

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.700
the, you know, Facebook board since 2007.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:45.960
So I kind of went through the entire

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.760
kind of crazy roller coaster that that company

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.700
went through over the last decade.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.420
And then, you know, we've been involved in,

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.400
you know, lots of these companies.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.100
You know, I was, you know, I was

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.020
an angel investor in Twitter, angel investor in

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.580
LinkedIn, you know, they both, you know, became

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.180
kind of key parts of the censorship machine

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.540
at certain points.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.740
And so I don't want to claim like

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:02.600
huge moral heroism.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.980
I do think a couple of things. One

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.500
is obviously Elon's purchase of Twitter, you know,

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.840
obviously was like a gigantic turning point.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.660
I also want to give just like enormous

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.380
credit to the Substack guys, you know, and

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.500
they were very proud because we were the

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.460
original investor and we're the largest outside investor

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.980
in Substack.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.720
And, you know, I think they did a

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.600
really, really great job holding the line of

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.100
freedom of speech under, and I would tell

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.260
you, under enormous pressure, you know, especially.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.500
And took a very consistent and totally principled

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.260
stand on it.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.460
Yeah, that's right. And they got, I don't

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:34.540
know if people remember this or not, but

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.040
I mean, they got really lit up, you

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.600
know, by a lot of the sort of,

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.180
you know, anti-speech forces for, you know,

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.980
I mean, the whole litany of, you know,

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.100
kind of standard accusations of just being absolutely

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.460
horrible.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.700
And yeah, they stuck to their principles the

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.260
whole time. And then they, you know, you

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.520
know, at least with Elon, it acts like

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.000
he's Elon.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.580
And so when he wants to go to

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.220
war with like, you know, somebody who's like

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.420
trying to get him to censor more, like

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.480
he does it in a very kind of

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.100
forced, you know, public visible and forceful way.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.900
You know, the Substack, you know, Substack's still,

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.140
you know, a younger company. And so they

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.480
don't have that level of kind of just

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.580
throw weight in the world yet.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.620
And so they have the harder version of

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.020
the challenge and they had to fight, you

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:10.020
know, a whole bunch of fights, including, you

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.200
know, fights that aren't even public, you know,

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.700
to basically keep the service with high integrity.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.000
So I think a good place to kind

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.080
of talk about a bunch of the themes

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.080
that we covered in the piece, one of

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.000
which is, I mean, the Substack investment.

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.420
I remember at the time I was on

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.580
Substack, my career was starting because of Substack,

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:27.880
and I still at the time thought it

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.360
was kind of a crazy investment.

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.280
Were you thinking about it from the perspective

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.340
of this is going to be a great

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.900
returner, this is something that is good for

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:35.360
the future?

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.560
Is it a mix of the two of

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.300
those things? And then to what extent have

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.760
you allowed Substack to fight that fight by

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.580
being on their side that they wouldn't have

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:44.520
been able to do if you weren't there?

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.380
Yeah, so, you know, we never make it,

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.640
you know, we never make investments for just

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:50.120
purely kind of social and political reasons.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.100
Like, so, you know, the goal, obviously, always

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.000
as sort of fiduciaries is to generate returns.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.320
And so, you know, in the main business.

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.740
And so, you know, we always invest with

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.220
the intention that the company that we invest

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.780
in, you know, has the opportunity to become

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.280
what we call kind of a cornerstone franchise,

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.220
you know, in the industry and an important

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:06.880
force in the world.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.460
And, you know, we certainly believe that as

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.540
Substack at the time. And, you know, we

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.260
believe that more than ever today. So I

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:12.780
think that's true.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.140
But I also think, you know, I think

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.500
this is kind of the magic in a

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.540
lot of what we do, you know, in

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:19.320
Silicon Valley, which is I think the companies

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.060
in many, not in every case, but in

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.800
many cases, the companies that become the best

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.440
version of themselves also become the most successful

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.820
businesses.

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:27.460
And I think Substack is a great example

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.160
of that. And Substack is actually a very,

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.180
very, very good example of that, because if

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.120
Substack is making its writers successful, then it's

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.020
making itself successful.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.320
Right. And so it's got this just like

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.860
extremely direct alignment of interest between its success

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.580
and its writers success. And then as a

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:43.180
consequence of that, if its writers are successful,

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.740
kind of by definition, you know, those writers,

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.460
you know, readers are successful. They're getting what

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.780
they want.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.520
And so, you know, I would say, you

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.820
know, there were sort of a bunch of

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.820
reasons we invested in Substack. You know, one

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.520
was just, you know, we fell in love

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.460
with the guys.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.360
And, you know, you probably know the guys

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.320
they're easy to fall in love with. So

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.140
that was the that was the easy part.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:02.980
And then, you know, look, I had been

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:04.880
around, you know, we had been around, you

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.220
know, you know, the web going all the

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.840
way back and then, you know, particularly the,

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:08.920
you know, the kind of golden age of

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.400
blogging, you know, was kind of this kind

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.720
of very, you know, special time.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.940
And, you know, you know, and blogging really,

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.200
you know, I think, you know, maybe gets

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.080
underestimated because maybe there was no single company

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.240
that kind of got full credit for it

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.540
or something.

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:22.020
But, you know, it really created the phenomenon

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.080
of blogging created an enormous amount of intellectual

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.700
content, you know, that basically was not going

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:27.320
to exist otherwise.

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.700
And then it just, you know, blogging kind

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.680
of just always had a series of problems

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.320
because there was no single company behind it.

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.960
But, you know, one of the problems was

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.680
bloggers just could it's very hard for bloggers

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:37.720
to make money. Right.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.240
And so, you know, the Substack guys basically

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.300
said, well, we're, you know, we're going to

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.440
do that. But, you know, we solved the

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:42.980
economic model.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.380
People are ready to pay now for content.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:45.800
And this makes sense.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.500
And then, you know, there was this chicken

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:48.760
and egg thing right up front, which was

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.300
like, well, you know, can you really see

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.420
that, you know, the Internet's a wash with

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:51.800
content.

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:53.800
People aren't paying for almost any of it.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:54.980
Like, are they really going to, you know,

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.960
you have to kind of squint and kind

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.460
of say, OK, are people actually going to

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:58.400
pay for any of the stuff that they're

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:58.800
getting today?

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.640
And I think the thing that in that

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.380
case that we were that we had faith

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.920
in was basically this could be what we

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.800
call a supply driven market, which is, right,

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.700
if you provide the monetization capability,

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.460
then you're going to bring into existence writers

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:12.820
and content that don't exist today.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.160
And that is the way to create new

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.560
demand that's not visible today. And then that

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.020
demand is going to come back around and

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:20.280
is going to incent more writers and more

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:20.620
content.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.400
And so it was basically a bet that

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.640
there's like an entire generation of high quality

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.120
content that doesn't exist because the monetization mechanism

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:27.620
doesn't exist.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.700
And that's, you know, that's certainly what Chris

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.060
and his partners believe. And I think that's

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.200
that's absolutely what's proven out.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:34.780
And so, yeah, I think it's like a

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:36.460
great example of founders that like really see

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:37.520
a future that doesn't exist yet.

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:40.180
And it's obvious to them. And unfortunately, in

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.600
that case, they were able to, you know,

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:42.320
convince us.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.220
Whenever we really screw up, it's because there's

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:46.380
a founder who can see the future and

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:47.420
they come and they sit in our office.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:48.520
They tell us what the future is and

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.060
we say, yeah, I don't really buy it.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:52.120
Right.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.700
And then for the next 30 years, you

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:54.840
know, we have to read about the, you

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.300
know, glorious success of this thing as that

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:57.140
future actually develops.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.180
And like that really sucks. And I don't

00:07:59.180 --> 00:07:59.980
like to talk about those.

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.640
But I will say, you know, Substack is,

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.360
you know, maybe they're just really good at

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:04.900
sales, but they fully convinced us.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:06.640
And I'm really thrilled that that's what's happening.

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.360
They were kind of ahead of the the

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.500
kind of change from old media to new

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.120
media in that, you know, as the brand

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.140
moved from The New York Times or The

00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:19.760
Wall Street Journal to the actual writers themselves,

00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:23.520
Substack was like a massive enabler for that.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.880
And, you know, they created this thing which

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.940
they call the non-fungible writer, which is,

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:29.260
you know, like how many things in the

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.420
newspaper could anybody write?

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:34.820
And including AI, by the way. And, you

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:37.440
know, how much is like truly like interesting

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.060
and valuable.

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:41.120
And they really wanted all the truly interesting

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.640
and valuable things to be able to build

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.380
their people, to build their own brands and

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.380
their own businesses on Substack.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.800
And that that would that that also turned

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:50.680
out to be very true.

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.160
Yeah. And that was where, you know, Hamish

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.380
in particular, right, turned out to be really

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.040
critical on their team, you know, and, you

00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.540
know, he and I had a conversation early

00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:58.840
on this where, you know, I was like,

00:08:58.880 --> 00:08:59.920
well, you know, I don't know, are these

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.160
people ever going to leave their publications?

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.680
Are they ever going to actually write content

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.480
that's that, you know, like, you know, when

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.120
Substack was gearing up, it's when, in my

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.260
view, the press kind of became this kind

00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:08.580
of extreme and negative monoculture.

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:10.240
And so I was like, all right, you've

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:11.120
got, you know, because he's like, you've got

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:12.220
all these writers kind of trapped at these

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:12.500
places.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:13.760
And I'm like, well, are they really trapped?

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:14.820
Like, are they, you know, are they in

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.140
jail or have they built the jail? Like,

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.500
you know, like, and if they leave, are

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:19.260
they going to be any different?

00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:21.080
Right. And he's like, look, if their only

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.160
option to basically put food on the table

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.760
is to work for a publication that basically,

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.640
you know, requires them to write a certain

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:28.980
way, then they're going to write that way,

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:30.260
you know, because they need to pay the

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:30.500
bills.

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.200
But he said, he basically said, I guarantee

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.380
you that there's a lot of these folks,

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.140
you know, where if they had an independent

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:36.600
path, they would take, you know, they would

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.380
be thrilled to be able to, you know,

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:39.640
maybe break themselves out of jail.

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:41.400
And they would be thrilled to, you know,

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.040
write about things, you know, from different angles

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.340
and have different tastes on things.

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:46.900
And, you know, you'd see this basically, you

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:49.700
know, this liberation phenomenon take place where you'd

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:51.200
have actually many different kinds of voices even

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:52.660
coming from people where you wouldn't expect it

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:53.760
based on the work that they did for,

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:54.860
you know, the New York Times or whoever.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.640
And, of course, he was 100% right.

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.520
You can see a world where because it

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:00.960
attracts kind of all of the best writers

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.280
from all of these different places who can

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.340
build their own businesses, Substack becomes 10 times

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:07.720
larger than any of the media organizations that

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:08.160
are places.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:11.300
I love the email that you sent to

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:13.960
Ali at Databricks, Ben, where you talk about

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.420
the fact that, you know, the business was

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:16.100
underselling itself.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:17.720
He was underselling the business and it was

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.000
going to be 10 times bigger than Oracle.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:19.980
So $2 trillion.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:21.180
Yeah.

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.780
I want to understand like the mechanism of

00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:22.900
that.

00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:25.180
Like, do you think that happens every generation

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:27.160
that the new companies are 10 times bigger?

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:28.620
Why does that happen?

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:29.560
Is it just software?

00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:31.540
Yeah.

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:33.480
So on that one, it was actually pretty

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.740
simple because if you compared the on-premise

00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:38.140
software companies to the cloud,

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:42.580
software companies, so compare PeopleSoft to Workday or

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:47.920
compare Siebel Software to Salesforce, the cloud version

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.220
was just 10 times bigger.

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.220
And Oracle was kind of the on-premise

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:53.260
version of Databricks.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:55.160
You know, kind of, you know, rough analog,

00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:56.280
you know, things are different.

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.420
You know, data is bigger and so forth.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.820
But if you look at like who is

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:06.820
going to be the data kind of provider

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:09.720
in the cloud, the provider of technology to

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.140
manage your data in the cloud, it was

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:13.860
going to, I mean, I was very confident

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:14.860
Databricks would win that.

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:16.520
And so then if you say, well, what's

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:17.520
the market size of that?

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:20.380
And by the way, you know, when I

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:23.240
said that AI wasn't as big as it

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.520
is, so I think that that's helping my

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:25.900
prediction.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:28.980
But, you know, like it was just clearly

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:29.980
going to be 10 times bigger.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:32.520
And I was like, Ali, why are you

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.720
trying to convince this candidate that you're going

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:35.500
to be worth $10 billion?

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.760
Like that's the, what are you even talking

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:39.000
about?

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:41.360
But, you know, Ali is super paranoid.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.560
So, you know, God bless him.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.500
So, you know, those are kinds of things.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.360
And like, you have to know your entrepreneur.

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.580
I mean, I think this is, you know,

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.180
one of the things that I think Mark

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:58.180
does very well is like, you know, that

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.520
advice isn't advice you give to every entrepreneur.

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:03.740
It's, you know, it was very worked well

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:04.780
specifically for him.

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:09.300
And I think that, you know, that's always

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:09.820
the case.

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:13.660
Like it's a very psychological game running a

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:14.040
company.

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:15.860
And so you have to kind of tap

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:20.980
in to that person's particular psychology to kind

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:23.480
of change the trajectory of what the company

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.880
is doing into the right direction.

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:26.820
And I'd also add, you know, back to

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:28.080
you on the Substack point, like I think

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.760
Substack could be like a thousand times the

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.980
size of the existing like content industry, whatever

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:33.140
you want to call it, media news industry,

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.380
the collective, you know, kind of value.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.900
And the reason is because, and, you know,

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:38.840
you're an example of this yourself.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.220
So, you know, my whole life, so I'm

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.440
like, you know, mid fifties.

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:43.880
And so like I grew up, you know,

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.680
when I was a kid and teenager, you

00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.380
know, the moral panic of the era was

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:47.720
television.

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:49.540
And it was just this like endless litany

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:51.440
of sort of social criticism, you know, from

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:53.160
kind of, you know, fancy people basically saying,

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.120
you know, consumers are, you know, basically normal

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:55.780
people are idiots.

00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:56.840
They just want to sit in front of

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:57.280
the boob tube.

00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:58.700
They just want to like be couch potatoes.

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:01.220
You know, the line everybody used at the

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:02.740
time was Americans watch six hours of TV

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:03.080
a day.

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.360
And then you turned on TV and you

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.140
just saw this, they have this term, the

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:07.740
vast wasteland of, you know, game shows and

00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:08.000
bullshit.

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:10.580
And it was just like this, like very

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:12.400
dystopian kind of thing of just like people

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.100
are just morons.

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.000
And then, you know, the internet version of

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.800
that is, of course, you know, that kind

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.620
of moral panic is transferred straight over onto

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:20.540
the internet in the form of, you know,

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:22.140
of course, you know, short form videos, TikTok.

00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:24.560
You know, people just want to watch, you

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.040
know, these stupid short form videos.

00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:27.680
And it's just playing the piano is the

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:28.400
original one, right?

00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:29.740
Yeah, exactly.

00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:30.620
Cat videos.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:32.360
By the way, I'm an aficionado of cat

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:32.600
videos.

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:33.860
I do not look down on cat videos

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:34.280
whatsoever.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.320
AI cat videos are my current favorite genre

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.660
of any form of entertainment.

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:38.440
So I will.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.320
The AI cat videos are very good.

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:41.380
I will.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:41.700
I will.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:42.540
Yes, Ben can confirm.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:44.020
I send her out a lot of AI

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:44.440
cat videos.

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.300
However, there is an enormous market for just

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.120
like mass media, just for like whatever, you

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:49.840
know, for whatever game shows or sitcoms or,

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.800
you know, soap operas or their modern versions

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:52.140
of those.

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.420
And there's a giant, you know, mass media

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:56.680
market for cat videos.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:59.120
But this goes back to this idea of

00:13:59.120 --> 00:13:59.860
supply driven market.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.980
There's also, I think, just like enormous latent

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:05.760
demand for actual smart, high quality stuff and

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.540
particularly in media and in every kind of

00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:08.760
media.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.560
And I think the issue is not lack

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:11.820
of demand.

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:12.920
I think the issue is lack of supply.

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.160
Because like this goes back to, you know,

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:17.780
kind of consumer marketing 101, which is consumer

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:19.280
people don't know what they want until it's

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:19.680
given to them.

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:19.880
Right.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:21.900
You know, nobody ever asked for a Macintosh.

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:23.040
Nobody ever asked for an iPhone.

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:24.280
Like, you know, these things had to be

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.020
designed and built, you know, provided on the

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:27.760
supply side before the demand materialized.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.380
And then the demand, of course, turned out

00:14:29.380 --> 00:14:30.700
to be, you know, far higher than anybody

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:31.280
expected.

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:33.460
And I think that that same thing is

00:14:33.460 --> 00:14:34.260
exactly true of media.

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:36.720
I think a great early existence proof of

00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.580
this was the success of long form podcasting,

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:40.900
you know, which is I remember my early

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:42.360
conversations with some of the early long form

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:42.840
podcasters.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.300
And they're like, it's the strangest thing we've

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.320
ever seen because everybody tells us that the

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.240
consumers have short attention spans.

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.440
But, you know, people are literally watching three

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.020
hour podcasts and we get the analytics and

00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.020
people are watching all the way to the

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:53.960
end of the three hour podcast.

00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:55.920
And so I view this very much as

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.240
like, you know, this is one of these

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.900
classic markets that's a barbell, which is, yeah,

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.400
you have a certain amount of whatever, just,

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.640
you know, whatever, you know, mainstream, you know,

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:04.920
sort of mainstream, whatever, you know, filler or

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:05.820
whatever on the one side.

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:08.540
But you have this massive sort of untapped

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.820
market for high quality content and basically every

00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:11.160
domain.

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:15.580
And they're just, you know, technological transformation, the

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:17.900
existing structure of the media company was a

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:19.340
structure that was designed for a world of

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:19.980
centralized media.

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:22.100
You need, you need a new structure today.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.260
And, you know, of course, that's, you know,

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.460
that's why we're so high on Substack.

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.400
But yeah, when we look at Substack, it's

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.560
the exact same thing that you were just

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:28.820
talking about with Databricks, which is like, wow,

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:30.960
this thing could be orders of magnitude,

00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:36.040
orders of magnitude multiples larger, you know, than

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:36.940
anything we've seen so far.

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:38.580
And, you know, frankly, I think we're starting

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:41.440
to see that implicit in kind of the

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:44.480
fund sizes that you raise is some kind

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.080
of view on how big the future is

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:46.420
going to be

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:48.020
or how much of the world technology is

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:50.160
going to eat over the next decade or

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:50.400
so.

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:53.100
What does 15 billion say about kind of

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:54.740
what the world looks like in a decade

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.540
and how many substacks there are that are

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:58.360
much bigger than whoever they're replacing?

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:03.560
Well, I think that we reinvented the computer.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:09.440
So and the new computer is far better

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:11.160
than the one that we have been kind

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.620
of building on for the last 50 or

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:14.100
so years.

00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:18.180
Well, really longer than that, but 50 in

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:22.600
earnest. And, you know, so there is that

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:23.700
I mean, we talk about this all the

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:24.240
time in the firm.

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.820
And there's not a problem that we can

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:29.220
think of that you can't that you won't

00:16:29.220 --> 00:16:30.420
be able to solve with A.I.

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:32.600
So like almost every problem in the world

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:37.520
and you, you know, from cancer to transportation,

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:40.700
transportation to massive fraud in the U.S.,

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:42.420
you just name a problem in the headlines.

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:45.060
And we're like, oh, yeah, we can solve

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:49.660
that. And so it's kind of the reinvention

00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:50.240
of everything.

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.500
So like all our our entire way of

00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:56.240
doing everything as humans, we think is going

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:56.720
to change.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:00.500
And so, you know, I would view it

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:02.580
as 15 billion to start for us because

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:06.220
there's so much to do and there's so

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:07.500
many things that are going to get built.

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:08.720
And, you know, like some of it is

00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.920
just timing with the entrepreneurs, but we think

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:12.900
the number of entrepreneurs is going to multiply

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:17.540
as well, because the kind of the the

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:20.500
ease of going from an idea to a

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:25.740
really fantastic solution and a fantastic product is

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:27.960
just going to be so much simpler.

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:29.280
Because, you know, one of the things that

00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.780
A.I. is best at, of course, is

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:35.160
kind of building stuff. And and so, yeah,

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:38.740
it's just a very unique time in kind

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:39.680
of the history of the world.

00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:42.380
Yeah. Yeah. The audio body experience I have

00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:43.360
with the A.I. on a regular basis

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:44.720
now is, you know, it's like, OK, I

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:45.760
think about the way Ben does and then

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:46.920
I'm like, all right, how might you apply

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:47.540
A.I. to solve?

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.320
Yeah. For example, the fraud scandal, you know,

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:50.420
the kind of fraud that we're seeing play

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:53.080
out or, you know, any anything like that.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.680
And it's like, oh, OK, I need to

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:55.920
think and think about how to how to

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:56.940
have A.I. solve this. And I'm like,

00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:57.900
oh, wait a minute. Why don't I ask

00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:58.540
the A.I.?

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:01.840
Yeah. Right. And then I go in there

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.460
and I'm like, you know, how should I

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:03.720
do this?

00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:05.520
And it's like, oh, well, here it's obvious

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:06.080
how you would do it.

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.240
And here's, you know, the 18 steps that

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:07.620
you would take.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:09.720
And then I tell it, well, you know,

00:18:09.820 --> 00:18:11.120
OK, like, you know, interview me, you know,

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:12.860
interview me on all the open questions in

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:13.940
the topic, you know, to get my thoughts

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:14.220
on them.

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:15.520
And then it starts, you know, it starts

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:16.940
interrogating me. Right.

00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.120
And then I'm like, OK, now give me

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.080
your point. And so it's just like, you

00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.620
know, as you know, like if you had

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:22.680
tried to do that with a normal computer

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:23.840
in the old days, it just like stare

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:24.040
at you.

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:28.700
Right. So like this is really, really, really

00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:29.000
different.

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.160
And then, you know, I think the venture

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.960
lens I would put on this is, you

00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.280
know, in terms of the mechanics of venture

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.840
capital, you know, the sort of classic, you

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.900
know, venture capital triangle is team, product and

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:39.160
market.

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:40.920
And you're always trying to kind of evaluate

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:41.520
all three of those.

00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:42.900
And people have always had, you know, different

00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:44.340
theories over the years of which of those

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:45.500
are more important than the others and how

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:46.660
they how they interact.

00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:50.980
But the thing that basically every investor, public

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:53.200
market investors, private investors, the thing that we're

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.020
all trained to do is basically market sizing.

00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:57.320
Like, you know, we're, you know, we're trained

00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.200
to do technology analysis.

00:18:58.380 --> 00:18:59.520
We're trained to do like, you know, background

00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:00.140
checks on people.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.640
And then we're trained to do market sizing.

00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.180
Like, you know, OK, how big is this

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:03.420
market?

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:05.880
Because, you know, the classic adage, right, is

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:06.960
if you if you put a huge amount

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.200
of effort into going after a small market,

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:09.140
you still get a small outcome.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.260
But there's a presumption in there, which is

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:15.080
that you can actually predict market sizes on

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:15.400
these things.

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.940
And the problem with that, again, is this

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:19.420
sort of this presumption that you can predict

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:21.240
market sizes based on the dynamics that exist

00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:21.960
in the market today.

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:25.000
But if there's a fundamental change on the

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.820
supply side, if there's if there's a fundamental

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:29.180
breakthrough, a fundamental capability that doesn't exist yet,

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.940
you're not going to be able to accurately

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:33.680
model the market size because you can't you

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:34.400
can't see it yet.

00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.320
Like, you've changed one of the major variables

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:37.460
and you can't do that.

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:39.020
And, you know, and then you could call

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:40.000
that the leap of faith or whatever.

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:41.280
But it's like, OK, if you if you

00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.600
make the change in the supply side, then

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:43.840
all of a sudden the market gets ten

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.040
or a hundred or a thousand times larger.

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:48.020
Like, you can almost never validate that with

00:19:48.020 --> 00:19:49.240
math at the time of the investment.

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:52.040
But that's the thing that makes the outperformers,

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:52.880
you know, really go.

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:55.620
And I just I just think like as

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:56.620
Ben and I kind of go through our

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:58.340
careers, we just see more and more examples

00:19:58.340 --> 00:19:59.980
where the mistake that we or others make

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:01.900
is, oh, this must be, you know, the

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:03.100
market for Uber and Lyft must be the

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:04.000
market for taxi cabs.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:06.440
Right. Or, you know, the market. Yeah. Or

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.200
the market for cloud software must be the

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.540
same as the market for on prem software.

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:10.800
Right.

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:14.180
Or the market for GPUs must be the

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:15.840
market for people who like to play games.

00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:19.240
Yes, exactly. And we just keep seeing example

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:22.340
after example after example where the significant enough

00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:24.500
technology change, product change on the supply side

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:25.740
unlocks much larger markets.

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:27.600
And I think that's going to be I

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:28.900
mean, I think, frankly, that's going to be

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:30.840
like the single like dominant trend in investing

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:31.820
for like the next 30 years.

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:33.540
I think that's just going to like telescope

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:33.880
way out.

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.860
The I think is so interesting, right, because

00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:38.280
from a technology perspective, it feels like you

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.160
can build products pretty immediately that are going

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:40.460
to win.

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:43.040
And then A16Z starts to make a lot

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.400
more sense in that context where it's like

00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.460
all of these other things.

00:20:45.660 --> 00:20:46.940
It's how do you do go to market?

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.400
How do you do policy? Like, how do

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.260
you set the conditions for the actual best

00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:52.760
technology to win as quickly as possible?

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.200
Like, how do you think about all the

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.540
different things that you do there? And is

00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:56.640
that the right way to think about it?

00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:58.760
Like the best technology should win and the

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:00.260
platform is there to make sure that that

00:21:00.260 --> 00:21:00.620
happens?

00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.520
You know, the way we always thought about

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:08.280
the firm was what can a partner do

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:12.260
for an entrepreneur that will not only help

00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:13.400
them ensure their success,

00:21:13.460 --> 00:21:15.960
but help them kind of build the company

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.180
they want to build and the way they

00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:18.380
want to build it with the people they

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:21.240
want to build it with and the culture

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:22.740
that they are proud of.

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:26.580
And to do that, there's many, many pieces.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:28.460
And a lot of it, you know, some

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:30.000
of it is just like very fundamental.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.560
Like, can you do your business in the

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.680
United States of America? Can you do it

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:35.120
in the world?

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.600
And so that's where the policy comes in.

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.280
It's just like a very basic question.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.400
And look, governments have a huge interest in

00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:45.680
technology these days, so like it's a necessary

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:46.100
one.

00:21:46.540 --> 00:21:48.760
A lot of the other things come down

00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:51.160
to, you know, how do you go from

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.880
being an inventor to being a competent CEO?

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:58.760
And that really is a confidence game, for

00:21:58.760 --> 00:21:59.920
lack of a better word.

00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:02.020
And that, you know, it's very difficult to

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:03.860
run an organization when you don't know what

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:06.680
you're doing, which nobody does when they're an

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:07.040
inventor.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:09.700
And you get tremendous amount of advice and

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:14.480
advice that's often extremely bad and almost the

00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:16.000
opposite of what you should be doing.

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.600
And there are very few like the people

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.140
who've actually built things don't have time to

00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:21.620
talk to.

00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:24.340
They're often away building things. So you get

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:27.440
these like advisors and, you know, Silicon Valley

00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.260
people who tell you how to run your

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:31.900
company, who to hire, this and that and

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:32.220
the other.

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:34.160
And then those things turn out to be

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.100
wrong and you get to this confidence spiral.

00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.560
And so we, you know, the whole firm

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:39.880
is built to put you in a kind

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.240
of a virtuous confidence cycle as opposed to

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.560
a vicious confidence cycle.

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:47.200
And that means like, oh, I need to

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:49.580
call somebody who's hard to get to like

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:52.600
an important CEO or like, you know, I've

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.700
got to recruit a top end engineer or

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:57.360
I have to figure out how to market

00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.600
my product or I have to get to

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.500
somebody important in the government.

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:05.360
If I can do that, my confidence builds.

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:07.320
If I can't do that, my confidence sinks.

00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:10.000
And so then, you know, once you're confident,

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.540
you can make decisions faster.

00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:14.280
You can, you know, build the company more

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.860
effectively. You can go for what you actually

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:17.160
want.

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:19.000
You can have confidence that, OK, what I

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.600
want is the right thing as opposed to

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.900
what somebody is whispering in my ear, you

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:25.820
know, who is whatever, a CEO coach or

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:27.300
a VC or this or that or the

00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:27.480
other.

00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:30.260
And so the whole firm is designed to

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:34.540
kind of enable that inventor to become a

00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:37.500
CEO and run their own company and put

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:40.760
their mark not just, you know, locally, but

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:44.080
in the world by being able to kind

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:44.960
of network to anyone.

00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:47.580
And so that's that's a lot of what

00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:48.060
we're about.

00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:49.660
Yeah.

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:51.200
And I just add the sort of macro,

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:52.540
you know, kind of outside inlines on that

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:55.600
is it's just like, you know, we get

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.280
to work with these, you know, super geniuses,

00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.320
but they're specifically they are super geniuses at

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:00.540
building products, building technologies.

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:02.720
You know, to be a super genius at

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:04.720
building technologies generally requires you to have been

00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:05.860
sitting in a lab or, you know, in

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:07.000
front of a screen for, you know, 10

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:07.540
or 20 years.

00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:11.860
You know, these folks are fully capable of

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:13.320
understanding everything about the world at large.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:15.100
They just haven't done it yet.

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.560
They just haven't been out and they haven't

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:18.740
met all the people and they haven't dealt

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:19.820
with all the issues in the real world.

00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:22.040
And so that leads to this kind of

00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:23.340
recurring, you know, kind of, I would say,

00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:25.520
misimpression sometimes that people have.

00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:26.900
It's just like, well, if you build the

00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:28.060
right product, you know, if you build the

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:30.560
breakthrough, whatever XYZ widget, like it's just the

00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.100
world is obviously going to adopt it.

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:33.080
Everybody's going to use it.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:34.620
It's just obviously going to, you know, kind

00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:35.140
of suit things.

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:37.620
And, you know, and basically if it doesn't,

00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:38.700
the answer is the product is not good

00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:38.900
enough.

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.300
And, you know, there's there's a little bit

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:40.840
of truth to that.

00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:42.360
Like, obviously, the better, the more breakthrough the

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:43.560
product, you know, the more there will just

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:44.260
be organic traction.

00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:47.420
But what virtually everybody finds, you know, up

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:49.460
to and including Elon Musk, right, what everybody

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.180
finds is the real world is just like

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:53.980
really, really big and really, really messy.

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:54.600
Right.

00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:57.100
And there are, you know, 8 billion people

00:24:57.100 --> 00:24:59.380
out there with like opinions that are not

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:00.760
necessarily, you know, your opinions.

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:03.280
And, you know, many of them have a

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:04.740
real vote as to what is going to

00:25:04.740 --> 00:25:06.240
happen with your product and with your company,

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:08.420
you know, including whether anybody buys, you know,

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.220
your thing or, you know, all of the

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:11.940
X factors that kick in, you know, all

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:13.220
the different ways that, you know, people are

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:14.040
going to come and try to, you know,

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:16.560
cripple what you're doing or, you know, or

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:17.760
maybe even worse than that, you know, just

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:18.220
ignore you.

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:19.100
Right.

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:19.120
Right.

00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:22.560
And so there is this there is this

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:24.140
just there is this really big world out

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:24.260
there.

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:25.040
It's really complicated.

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:25.660
It's really messy.

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:27.540
It's not necessarily in favor of new ideas.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.780
In many cases, it really, really doesn't like

00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:30.680
them and wants to reject them.

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:33.980
And there's real art and science, you know,

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:36.400
to Ben's point, to building the company around

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.400
the product and the founder to be able

00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:39.820
to take the breakthrough and be able to

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:41.180
take it successfully into the world.

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:43.440
And as far as we can tell, as

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:44.900
far as I can tell, like that that

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:47.520
process is getting, you know, hairier and more

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:48.480
complicated over time.

00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:49.200
Right.

00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:50.340
It's not getting easier.

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.440
It seems like it's actually getting significantly harder.

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:54.620
And so, yeah, that's that's a big part

00:25:54.620 --> 00:25:55.540
of what the what the firm is built

00:25:55.540 --> 00:25:57.600
to do is really help founders work through

00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:57.740
that.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.720
And one of the things that Mark said

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:01.080
in the past, which is really true, is

00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.440
like, look, as an inventor, you're looking for

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:05.000
power, like a power boost.

00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:08.260
So how do I go from little old

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:11.560
me with my invention to like I'm the

00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:13.160
important company in the space in the world?

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.000
I can build momentum.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.360
I can get the best engineers.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.840
I can get the, you know, customers faster.

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:19.760
And that that turns into a snowball and

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:20.480
I'm rolling downhill.

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:23.180
And so the whole firm is designed as

00:26:23.180 --> 00:26:26.220
like a very powerful entity that you can

00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:29.480
just tap into and, you know, take our

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:33.100
brand, take our connections, take our expertise and

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:34.340
become extremely powerful.

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:35.320
Very fast.

00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:36.380
Yeah.

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:37.920
And by the way, this, this, this, you

00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.060
know, this, this is the solution to the

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:40.320
puzzle that people have had about us for

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.480
a long time, which is, wow, it seems

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:43.060
like those guys are like, you know, awfully

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:43.500
promotional.

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:45.040
You know, they're, they're, you know, they're, you

00:26:45.040 --> 00:26:46.300
know, they do all this marketing stuff that,

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:47.460
you know, they're doing all this politics stuff.

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:48.980
You know, they, they must be doing this

00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:49.600
for ego reasons.

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:50.680
They must be really fool themselves.

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:51.800
You know, this must be about, you know,

00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:52.640
They talk so much shit.

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:54.800
They talk so much shit, like the whole

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:54.980
thing.

00:26:55.060 --> 00:26:56.220
And at least, you know, for, and maybe,

00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:58.480
maybe, maybe, maybe it's possible, possible we talk

00:26:58.480 --> 00:26:58.880
too much shit.

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:01.520
I'll let other people judge that from time

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:02.780
to time, maybe.

00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.460
However, however, from the beginning, the goal was

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:09.680
to build the, the purpose of building the

00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:11.600
dominant venture brand was precisely to be able

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.060
to have the companies be able to borrow

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:14.880
that at the most critical points in their

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:17.060
development so that the companies can kind of

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:19.020
use, use, use our force in the world

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:20.580
as a slingshot to basically build their own

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:20.840
force.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.560
And, and I think that's worked really well.

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:23.720
And that's why we don't, you know, shrink

00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:24.560
back from a lot of these things.

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:25.480
Yeah.

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:27.620
I wanted like, just squeeze something in and

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:28.760
then get right back on this conversation.

00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:30.560
Talking too much shit is so interesting, but

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:31.540
I really love it.

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:32.600
I think the thing that impressed me the

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:34.720
most when I started working with the crypto

00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:37.160
team was seeing never take the negative in

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:39.400
person and like never talk shit on a

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.960
technology, never talk shit on a founder, never

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:42.780
talk shit on a company.

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:44.800
Like, how do you even train for that?

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:46.140
Cause that really, really impressed me.

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:47.020
Well, we train for that.

00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:49.020
We train for that.

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:54.160
So, uh, we have a culture, um, that

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:57.520
is written culture that you cannot join the

00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:02.020
firm unless you sign a document, uh, the

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:03.740
culture document and says you will adhere to

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:04.240
this culture.

00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:07.620
And, uh, then you must sit through one

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:11.220
hour with me, uh, understanding the culture and

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:15.560
fundamentally on that, you know, our whole point

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:18.600
is if you want to do something larger

00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.200
than yourself and make the world a better

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:21.960
place, we are a hundred percent for it.

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:23.240
And we do not care.

00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:26.800
Uh, you know, like if in the moment

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:29.340
we think you're making a mistake or like

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:30.900
the ideas and good, and it doesn't matter

00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:32.280
if we invest in you or don't invest

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:32.700
in you.

00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:34.360
Um, we're for that.

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:35.320
We are dream builders.

00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:36.400
We're not dream killers.

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:40.700
We're not here to be like the analytical

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:43.880
smarty pants who makes ourselves look smart by

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:45.260
making somebody else look stupid.

00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:49.160
And that's just, that's fundamental to how we

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:50.080
think about the world.

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:54.120
Um, so like anybody who's trying to push

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:56.520
the world forward and make it better, like

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.020
whether we agree with their method or not,

00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:00.080
like we're for it.

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:03.720
And so, uh, you, we just ask you

00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:05.840
to sign up to that idea before you

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:06.280
ever join.

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:09.480
Catherine said that, that, uh, you know, we

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:10.940
believe in the future and bet the firm

00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:12.360
that way was, should actually be the number

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:14.100
one, uh, kind of value in the, in

00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:14.400
the culture.

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:16.180
By the way, that, that, that was Mark's.

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:18.460
Um, you know, I, I did the wording,

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:19.800
so I give myself a little credit, but

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:20.640
that was Mark's idea.

00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:24.020
Do you think that should be number one?

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:25.400
Do you think that is number one in,

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:26.040
in practice?

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:27.220
Do you think first class business in a

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:28.700
first class way is like, if you were

00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:30.860
to rewrite the doc today, what is the

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:31.940
most important thing in the, in the firm?

00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:35.720
Well, look, I mean, the culture document is

00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:39.520
seven things that, um, you know, and the

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:40.420
culture is more than that.

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:42.540
Every culture is more than seven, seven ideas

00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:44.680
and kind of seven sets of behaviors.

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:48.660
But those are the ones that all seven

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:51.080
of them that we really expect everybody to

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:51.480
live to.

00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:53.560
Um, so I, I don't know if I

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:56.060
rank them in that sense because they all

00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:56.540
go together.

00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:58.420
They're part of a single thing.

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:01.720
So, um, you know, we believe in the

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:04.300
future means that we believe in the people

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:06.000
who build the future, which means we're not

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.540
going to criticize them, which means, you know,

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:11.040
we're not going to, we're not going to

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:12.240
be on the attack side of that.

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.680
We're never going to attack the future. We're

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:15.320
going to try and make, you know, there

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:16.560
are going to be problems with how we

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:17.860
build the future, but we're going to try

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:19.120
and make it the best future we can.

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:21.160
We're not going to try and live in

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:21.660
the past.

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:24.840
Uh, and so that you can't do that.

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:27.540
If you're attacking entrepreneurs all the time, you

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:28.320
can't do that.

00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:31.420
If you show up, you know, an hour

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:33.120
late to meet with somebody who's trying to

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:34.840
build a company, you can't do those kinds

00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:35.280
of things.

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:38.460
And so every part of the culture, I

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:41.340
think, is in support of, we want to

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:43.200
build a better future. Like that is, that's

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:43.740
why we're here.

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:48.360
Haber, uh, in his piece, firm kind of

00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.140
greater than fund talks about, you know, a

00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:51.600
firm is something that tries to build a

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:52.900
compounding competitive advantage.

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.440
And he points to one thing for Apollo,

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.860
one thing for Goldman. If you had to

00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:58.600
pick a thing, what are you compounding?

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:00.340
Like, what is the competitive advantage that you're,

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:01.580
that you're building over time? Do you think

00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:01.740
here?

00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:03.380
Reputation.

00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:07.660
We, Mark and I talked about that from

00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:08.800
the day we started the firm.

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:11.260
And, and by, by the way, there were

00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:13.060
times when it was like, well, we're investing

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:14.340
an awful lot in reputation.

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:17.120
Um, and you know, it's taken a while.

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:20.080
Uh, but it is, that's what we compete

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:20.260
on.

00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:21.740
Like when we, when we talk to an

00:31:21.740 --> 00:31:25.140
entrepreneur, um, and they're comparing us to another

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:29.040
firm, we say, find an entrepreneur that's taken

00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:30.900
investment from both firms, see what they say.

00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:32.480
Like that's our answer to everything.

00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:35.900
Uh, we, we build reputation.

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.360
Every relationship matters.

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:39.260
Everybody who we touch, we try and touch

00:31:39.260 --> 00:31:40.420
as many people as we can.

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:43.060
And we try and, um, represent in the

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:45.840
very, very best way possible to build reputation

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:46.340
over time.

00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:49.000
And that compounds and compounds and compounds across,

00:31:49.260 --> 00:31:53.620
uh, entrepreneurs, across industries, across sectors, across, you

00:31:53.620 --> 00:31:55.420
know, everybody from, you know, people in the

00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:58.980
government to, uh, you know, people in, uh,

00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:02.400
in companies that, that we don't invest in.

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:05.180
And, um, anybody who is anywhere in the

00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:06.800
world of technology, we want, we want them

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:08.640
to know us and we want them to,

00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:11.180
uh, think of us as the best, uh,

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:12.500
firm to do business with.

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:13.680
Yeah.

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:15.360
And then that, and then that transfers, of

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:17.840
course, that transfers from us, that transfers to

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:18.740
the portfolio companies, right?

00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:20.200
So that, which is the goal of it,

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:21.640
which is that then as a consequence, when

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:23.340
a, when a company takes investment from us,

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.460
now they, they're basically able to use our

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:27.660
reputation to get themselves through the, through those,

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:28.700
those, those, those, you know, kind of key

00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:30.780
growth phases with, you know, with, with potential

00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:33.260
customers and with recruits and with downstream investors

00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:35.020
and with, you know, regulators and with, you

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:36.880
know, all, all these different, you know, forces

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:37.760
in the external society.

00:32:38.220 --> 00:32:40.280
Um, so the, the, the, the, the reputation

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:41.800
pays off, not just for us, but it

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.420
pays off in the form of, uh, what

00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:44.720
our, what our portfolio companies are able to

00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:45.220
do as a result.

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:47.600
So having done this for 16, 17 years,

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:49.760
like, are there things about building and transferring

00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:51.760
reputation that you've learned that are not obvious?

00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:53.420
Because to me, like, it would almost seem

00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:54.100
that it's a battery.

00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:55.440
And if you give it to one company

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.520
that messes it up, then the whole thing

00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:58.280
kind of falls apart.

00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:00.260
But actually it, maybe it's like love to

00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:01.620
be like super cheap, like it just grows

00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:02.320
the more you give it.

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:04.540
Are there other things like that, that, that

00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:04.860
you've learned?

00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:07.880
Well, look, I, I, I do think that

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:10.980
that's a correct insight in that, you know,

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:16.480
one mistake is much more powerful than, you

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:18.180
know, one good deed.

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:22.760
Um, so, you know, one person being obnoxious,

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:25.380
uh, who's in the firm or lying to

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:28.160
an entrepreneur or doing something like that is

00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:30.340
causes much more damage than you can do

00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:31.740
by doing that correctly.

00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:34.760
Uh, you know, five or 10 times, um,

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:36.880
which is why you have to be so

00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:38.040
vigilant about it.

00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:40.560
Like you, you, you can't, you cannot tolerate

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:42.060
that kind of behavior.

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:47.480
Um, but I, I, I think that the,

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:49.060
the thing, the biggest thing that I've learned

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:52.140
is it takes a long time to build

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:52.800
a reputation.

00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:56.560
Uh, and, but once you do, it's, it's,

00:33:56.580 --> 00:33:57.520
it's the most powerful thing.

00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:58.700
It really does compound.

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:00.700
Um, and just to give you an example,

00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:03.100
look, when Mark and I raised fund one,

00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:05.420
it was a $300 million fund.

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:09.200
Um, I think it took about six months

00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:09.740
to raise.

00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:15.580
Uh, we had a lot of meetings.

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:17.640
I can't, I can't count how many meetings.

00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:19.500
Um, some people did not treat us very

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:21.840
well as, uh, Trump might say, they didn't

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:22.640
treat me well at all.

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:25.680
Uh, very badly.

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:29.480
Um, and you know, this raise, which was

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:32.000
$15 billion when we actually raised the fund,

00:34:32.220 --> 00:34:35.700
I think Mark did one AMA and I

00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:36.680
did one AMA.

00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:38.160
And I don't, I don't know that I

00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:40.080
took another meeting on this fundraise.

00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:42.480
Uh, and it was done on the, on

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:43.060
the reputation.

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:47.880
And so, um, that's a, that's a heck

00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.860
of a change, you know, and look, a

00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:51.800
lot of, not that we don't, we talk

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:52.920
to our investors all the time.

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:54.680
I mean, I've been all around the world,

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:56.920
uh, building relationships and so forth, but when

00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:00.000
we came to ask for money, uh, it

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.560
was raised entirely on the reputation.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.940
I think, Paki, I think the, um, the

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:06.260
external environment has changed, you know, enormously.

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.820
Um, and so, you know, we've, we've lived

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:10.580
this, you know, as you have and many

00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:12.520
others, we've, you know, this incredible transformation where

00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:14.680
tech both is like much, much, much larger

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:16.380
and more central now than it was in

00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:17.320
2009 when we started.

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:19.060
But also, you know, the, the level of,

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.660
let's just say engagement on the, on the

00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:23.380
part of the world attack is, you know,

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:25.220
the, the level of intensity on everything from,

00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:27.200
you know, you know, attacks, you know, criticism,

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:29.000
you know, by the way, you know, completely

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.480
justifiable questions, you know, impact on society.

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:33.420
You know, the, the, the intensity level is,

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:34.220
you know, I don't know, it's like a,

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:35.560
I don't know, like a thousand X of

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:37.040
what it was 16 years ago.

00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:38.480
And so I, I think, you know, I

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:39.720
think to your question, I think we've, we've

00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:40.820
really tried to kind of rise to that,

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:42.520
uh, on both sides.

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:43.700
Like we're really trying to help these, you

00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:45.460
know, these companies get to levels of scale

00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:47.160
that nobody ever thought was possible before.

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:48.540
But at the same time, we're trying to

00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:50.200
help them deal with pressures that previous generations

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:51.600
of founders, you know, generally didn't have to

00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:51.900
deal with.

00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:52.160
Yeah.

00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:55.040
You seem like you uniquely maybe of anybody

00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:57.700
that I know have fun taking, you know,

00:35:57.740 --> 00:35:59.080
like engaging in these conversations.

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:00.200
And I wrote about it a little bit

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:01.700
in the piece, but like kind of stepping

00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:03.180
outside the situation and viewing it.

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:04.500
I don't like what goes on in your

00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:05.540
head in these situations.

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:06.760
Like, are you having as much fun as

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:07.320
it looks like?

00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:08.740
Does it take a toll ever kind of

00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:09.480
like taking the arrows?

00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:11.320
What does it feel like in these?

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:13.360
Yeah.

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:13.740
Ben, what?

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:13.900
Yeah.

00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:14.620
Why don't you, yeah.

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:15.880
Ben will give the rational response.

00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:17.360
Yeah.

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:20.160
I would say it's.

00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:20.600
I'll give the vote.

00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:23.440
I mean, it gets emotional from time to

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:23.660
time.

00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:23.860
Right.

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:24.280
Because.

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:27.900
You know what goes into building these things

00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:31.860
and, you know, the intentions of the people

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:33.720
building them and, you know, like the kind

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:34.980
of impact they have on the world.

00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:38.500
And then to just get like, you know,

00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:40.800
and a lot of the attacks tend to

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.920
be in the form of character assassinations and

00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:43.380
so forth.

00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:48.540
And now everybody thinks Mark's Jewish, you know,

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:49.960
just so they can attack him more.

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:51.920
It turns out people love to attack Jewish

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:52.280
people.

00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:55.340
So I welcome him into that.

00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:56.960
My new name.

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:57.420
My new name.

00:36:57.420 --> 00:36:57.880
My new name.

00:36:58.120 --> 00:36:59.640
Packy is in certain political circles is Andy.

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:02.120
Uh, as, as, uh, as, um, Andy Horowitz.

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:04.600
Because people think that people think Andrew and

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:06.280
the, and the, and the swamp fringes of

00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:06.440
the internet.

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:08.240
People think Andrew Horowitz is a Jewish person.

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:08.680
Yeah.

00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:10.760
Um, and so I, I now introduce myself

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:11.000
as.

00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:12.420
Yeah.

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:13.580
I didn't have that in my Twitter bio.

00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:14.600
I did have it in my Twitter bio.

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:15.360
My real name is Andy.

00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:17.080
It's Andy Horowitz, but, uh, and I am

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:18.060
Jewish, but I took it down.

00:37:18.540 --> 00:37:18.780
Yeah.

00:37:18.940 --> 00:37:21.960
But I, I would say mostly it, it's

00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:24.640
just like, it's an amazing, um,

00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:28.580
it's just like an amazing thing and amazing

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:32.580
privilege, uh, to kind of be in the

00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:33.220
center of it all.

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:37.040
Uh, and, you know, like, and then the

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:39.280
responsibility that goes with it, that you, you

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:41.060
have to kind of try and help drive

00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:42.120
the world to the right answer.

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:49.000
Uh, but like, it's, I don't know if

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.500
fun is the right word, but like, it's

00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:51.820
special.

00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:53.640
It's like, we've gotten to a very special

00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:56.440
position and I think, you know, both of

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.580
us try and take it as seriously as

00:37:58.580 --> 00:37:59.060
we can.

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:01.480
And, you know, like things happen and we

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:05.700
have very, very long discussions about how we

00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:07.120
should react to certain things.

00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:09.180
Um, how we should not react to certain

00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:11.480
things, um, what we can take a position

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:13.320
on, what we shouldn't take a position on.

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:16.560
Um, uh, and, you know, just to have,

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:17.800
just to be, you know, at this stage

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:19.380
of life, to be able to be talking

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:22.140
about that as opposed to, um, the things

00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:23.580
that we had to talk about when we

00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:25.700
were building Netscape or, or, or Opsware.

00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:27.520
Like it's, it's amazing.

00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:30.480
Uh, and, uh, you know, I, I definitely

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:31.060
wouldn't trade it.

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:35.000
Um, and, and look, we're, we've been through,

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:36.720
we've been criticized so much at this point

00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:40.540
that like it really, it bothers interestingly, which

00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:41.940
I never thought I'd see is it kind

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:43.840
of bothers people inside the firm much more

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:45.000
than it bothers Mark or me.

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:46.320
Sure.

00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:48.400
And I am just for the record studying

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:49.120
for my bar mitzvah.

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:49.600
Yeah.

00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:51.140
Yeah.

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:51.400
Yeah.

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:52.200
The half Torah.

00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:53.800
You, you need to learn your, your half

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:54.420
Torah tropes.

00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:55.060
Yeah.

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:58.580
How do you avoid at this point becoming

00:38:58.580 --> 00:38:59.840
a big company?

00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:01.700
Like this is becoming a big organization.

00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:03.660
How do you avoid being a big company?

00:39:03.780 --> 00:39:04.780
Google wanted to avoid that.

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:05.840
Like everyone wants to avoid that.

00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:07.140
How do you actually do that?

00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:09.020
Yeah.

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:10.620
So I think a lot of that is

00:39:10.620 --> 00:39:11.700
organizational design.

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:16.580
I mean, it, so if you look at

00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:19.100
the companies that didn't feel like big companies,

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:20.440
companies for a long time, they, they had

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:22.860
very, very, very thoughtful design to the organization.

00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:26.040
And if you look at the firm, um,

00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:28.260
you know, the crypto group or the infra

00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:31.760
group or the, um, you know, the apps

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:33.820
group or the American dynamism group, they, they

00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:36.240
all feel like small companies.

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:38.440
And they're, they're, they're small companies with a

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:40.400
kind of very specific kind of support.

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:43.300
Uh, you know, in terms of the brand,

00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:46.060
in terms of, uh, fundraising and other kinds

00:39:46.060 --> 00:39:46.540
of things.

00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:48.700
Um, but he, you know, the, the, the

00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:50.240
fundraising team is a small group.

00:39:50.340 --> 00:39:52.440
And so the every, and every group is

00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:54.680
very autonomous from every other group.

00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:58.020
Like, uh, there's integration points, but they're, they're

00:39:58.020 --> 00:39:58.600
very simple.

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:01.180
And so, you know, for the most part,

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:02.880
there, there's some that are more complicated than

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:03.180
others.

00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:07.400
Um, and so, you know, that's what makes

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:09.420
it, you know, the, the beauty of a,

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:12.300
of a small place is you can just

00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:13.020
sketch it done.

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:15.360
The beauty of a big place is you're

00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:16.060
very powerful.

00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:17.960
Um, and so we try and kind of

00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:18.620
blend those two.

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:19.500
We took a lot.

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:20.980
We, Mark and I borrowed a lot.

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:24.660
Um, early on, we really studied Hewlett Packard,

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:28.820
uh, which the, the original Hewlett Packard before

00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:31.660
the computer business kind of swallowed the company

00:40:31.660 --> 00:40:32.780
was very much like this.

00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:35.120
They had, uh, they were like a series

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:37.720
of companies inside a company and, and that's

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:38.340
a lot how we are.

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:41.180
How do you vet GPs or like, it

00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:42.140
seems like you have to put a lot

00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:43.500
of trust in the people that are running

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:44.400
the different teams.

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:46.620
If the whole thing is reputation, but you

00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:47.800
need to be able to scale by having

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:49.040
these kinds of decentralized teams.

00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:51.120
Is there anything that you do there that's,

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:54.520
that's unique or, or weird, uh, that ensures

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:56.140
that kind of like no one group can

00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:57.020
infect the whole?

00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:00.320
Well, I think, look, first of all, in

00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:02.880
order to lead one of those groups, you

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:06.040
just have to have been here and performed

00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:06.860
for a long time.

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:09.220
So that, that, that's kind of the first

00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:09.420
thing.

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:10.880
So we just know you extremely well.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.900
We're not, we're not interviewing people for that

00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:13.800
job from the outside.

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:15.400
Like you can't get that job from the

00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:15.740
outside.

00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:21.420
And then, you know, I would say because

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:26.100
our culture is so different than other venture

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:28.460
firms, you know, for, for better or worse,

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:31.260
we're just different that we don't hire a

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:33.140
lot of outside GPs anymore.

00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:37.200
We generally try to hire people at an

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:39.080
earlier stage of their career and kind of

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:40.420
grow them into what we do.

00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:43.200
Um, and that's where much, much better for

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:43.400
us.

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:46.060
I would say in general, although we have

00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:47.600
like, uh, all of us came from the

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:50.340
outside at one point of the original cast.

00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:51.800
That makes sense.

00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:55.140
Um, kind of winding down here, but Mark,

00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:56.580
you said that, uh, I think you got

00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:58.140
shit at one point for saying the VC

00:41:58.140 --> 00:41:59.800
was going to be the last job, uh,

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:00.880
in, in the world.

00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:03.620
Uh, you know, if you, if the vision

00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:05.500
of the future that you believe is true,

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:07.280
and this is going to be an institution

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:09.180
that, that lasts for a century, like what

00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:11.740
does A16Z look like and do a century

00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:12.140
to now?

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:13.340
Right.

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:13.800
Yeah.

00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:15.100
So I'll start with, I believe I was

00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:15.440
misquoted.

00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:16.820
I believe it was a, it was one

00:42:16.820 --> 00:42:19.000
of these, uh, hypothetical, uh, thought experiment things

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:20.840
that, uh, kind of got, got, uh, overly,

00:42:20.840 --> 00:42:23.240
um, extrapolated, but, uh, I, I guess I

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:25.000
shouldn't just, uh, defend myself.

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:27.420
Um, so I, the, the, the, the point

00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:28.220
of what I was trying to get across

00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:30.300
in that discussion, um, which we, you know,

00:42:30.360 --> 00:42:31.840
I think if you both the original, it's,

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:32.840
it's a longer form discussion on it.

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:35.120
It is, goes back to what, what Ben

00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:37.560
said early on, which is there is this

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:39.000
repeating pattern in history.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.360
I mean, we, we can find examples of

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:41.720
it for sure going back 500 years.

00:42:42.300 --> 00:42:45.060
Um, uh, is this repeating pattern, which is

00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:46.740
basically a person with a dream.

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:49.280
Um, a person with a deep level of

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:52.420
domain knowledge, um, and a dream, um, operating

00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:55.880
in a domain with asymmetric payoff, um, right,

00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:57.840
with, with risk and reward, where, you know,

00:42:57.900 --> 00:42:58.980
by the way, the, the dream may be

00:42:58.980 --> 00:42:59.180
wrong.

00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:00.260
Like they, they may not be able to

00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:00.740
do the thing.

00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:02.020
Um, but if they can do the thing,

00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:03.760
it will, it will have disproportionately high returns.

00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:07.880
Um, you know, the traditional institutional, you know,

00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:10.020
places people go to get support and funding,

00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:12.180
you know, for the dream, you know, for,

00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:13.900
for, for, for new projects, just turn it

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:16.020
down because, you know, a bank can't finance,

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:17.700
you know, a bank, a bank can't issue

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:19.980
a loan against something with a 50%, you

00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:21.360
know, 50% chance of a 10 accident,

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:22.340
50% chance of failure.

00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:23.760
Like a bank just can't underwrite that.

00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:25.220
So a bank won't do that.

00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:26.420
Big companies, you know, for the most part,

00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:27.000
won't do that.

00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:29.260
Um, uh, you know, almost nobody will do

00:43:29.260 --> 00:43:29.520
that.

00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:32.040
Um, but, but somebody has a dream and

00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:33.600
then, you know, when the dream works and

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:35.440
especially if you can construct a portfolio of

00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:36.960
those dreams and of those people, you know,

00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:38.460
then the expected, you know, value on that

00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:39.680
is, is going to be very high.

00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:42.280
Like, like that's a very special thing.

00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:44.080
Um, I, I've had long conversations with Tyler

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:46.360
Cohen, who's very, particularly is very thoughtful on

00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:46.480
this.

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:48.960
And he has a term, forget the exact

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:50.120
term that he is, it's like, it's, it's

00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:52.800
like some combination talent picker, project picker.

00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:55.560
Um, and it's, it's this thing, you know,

00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:56.420
it's like, we were talking about earlier about

00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:56.880
market size.

00:43:56.980 --> 00:43:58.100
It's this thing where like, there is an

00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:00.540
analytical scientific component to it, but there's also

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:01.860
like an art to it.

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:03.680
And there's, there, there's some intangible cause you're,

00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:05.160
you're dealing with human beings at a very

00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:07.320
kind of primordial level, you know, kind of,

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:08.800
you know, kind of very early in the

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:10.040
process of doing something that hasn't been done

00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:10.320
before.

00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:13.400
Um, and, you know, quite honestly, like, you

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:14.680
know, an early example of this was, you

00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:16.220
know, Queen Isabella with Christopher Columbus.

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:16.580
Right.

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:18.080
Um, and I, I was just like, I

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:20.100
was just, I was trying to picture the

00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:20.460
pitch.

00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:20.920
Right.

00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:22.500
You know, Christopher Columbus rolls in.

00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:23.220
Right.

00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:25.020
And he's like, you know, all right, you

00:44:25.020 --> 00:44:25.900
know, here's, you know, I'm going to find

00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:27.180
a new route, you know, route to India,

00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:27.660
by the way.

00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:28.660
You know, there's like a, I don't know,

00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:30.640
whatever 50, 60% chance that, you know,

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:31.560
you'll never hear from me again.

00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:33.900
Um, and you know, you know, maybe, you

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:35.800
know, maybe, maybe I've, you know, died 2000

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:37.120
miles away from Spain.

00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:38.300
Maybe I may, by the way, maybe I

00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:39.260
just like ran away with the money.

00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:40.500
It's not like they had Interpol in those

00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:40.700
days.

00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:41.260
Yeah.

00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:43.260
Um, and I'm going to go do that.

00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:44.500
And then, and by the way, the, the

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:45.980
fact that that bet paid off, but like,

00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:46.960
that, that, that, that, like.

00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:48.880
The whole, the whole idea was wrong.

00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:49.380
Yeah.

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:51.360
But the whole, the whole idea was wrong.

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:52.220
The whole idea was wrong.

00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:53.480
He discovered a completely different continent.

00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:54.820
And he himself did not believe that he

00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:56.040
had discovered a completely different continent.

00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:57.200
Right.

00:44:57.200 --> 00:44:58.900
Um, and I don't even know that Spain

00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:00.080
was the main beneficiary of that in the

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:00.400
long run.

00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:00.580
Right.

00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:02.680
Like, and so like, but like, you know,

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:04.680
like she funded it and like, wow.

00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:05.240
Right.

00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:05.900
Yeah.

00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:07.060
And then there's, there's a lot of gold.

00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:08.700
Yeah.

00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:09.220
Yeah, exactly.

00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:09.480
Yes.

00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:10.600
They, they did, they did find some gold.

00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:12.080
They're very similar story, by the way.

00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:13.780
The Puritans have a, you know, the Plymouth

00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:15.380
Rock, the, that whole thing, the Mayflower, they

00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:17.360
have a very similar story, uh, to that.

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:18.880
It took, I think 20 years to raise

00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:20.400
the financing, uh, to be able to make

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:21.480
the, uh, make the Mayflower

00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:21.940
Expedition.

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:23.940
Um, and they needed, they needed, you know,

00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:24.640
backers like that.

00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:25.760
You know, that we, we always talk now

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:27.180
about in the venture industry, you know, the

00:45:27.180 --> 00:45:27.480
whaling

00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:30.100
industry 400 years ago, um, you know, operated

00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:30.980
in a very similar way.

00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:32.660
The, the movie industry has always worked this

00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:32.800
way.

00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:34.220
The book publishing industry has always worked this

00:45:34.220 --> 00:45:34.440
way.

00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:36.560
By the way, politics has always, you know,

00:45:36.620 --> 00:45:38.200
worked, political campaigns work this way that,

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:39.940
you know, any, any, any new, you know,

00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:41.500
future president starts out as a long shot,

00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:42.660
somebody bets on them.

00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:44.760
And so there's, there's this intangible that has

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:46.440
to do with making, making these long dated

00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:46.680
bets

00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:48.700
with very uncertain outcomes and with high failure

00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:48.980
rates.

00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:51.580
And I mean, like if, yes, like I

00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:52.500
think what I said in the original interview

00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:52.760
is like,

00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:53.940
look, if we're gonna have AI do that,

00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:55.600
like, God bless, like, I'm gonna, like, I'm

00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:55.660
gonna

00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:56.780
hit the beach and like, it's all good.

00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:00.600
Um, but you know, uh, like, I, I

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:02.340
guess maybe make the following claim and see,

00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:02.780
Ben, what

00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:04.840
you think of this, the intangibles seem to

00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:06.500
be becoming more important, not less important

00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:06.880
over time.

00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:09.560
Um, it seems to be becoming more like

00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:10.980
an art and less like a science as

00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:11.240
we go.

00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:12.040
Would you agree with that?

00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:14.660
I, I definitely think that's right because, uh,

00:46:15.380 --> 00:46:16.520
history, um,

00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:18.920
is a bad guide.

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:22.240
Uh, so you can't like the, the, the,

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:24.040
the interesting thing about VC for me, probably

00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:24.440
the biggest

00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:26.840
lesson is you gotta be very careful about

00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:28.160
a highly trained neural net.

00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:30.880
Um, because that's when you make the mistakes

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:32.080
because things change.

00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:34.460
And I would say things have changed more

00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:34.900
rapidly.

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:37.040
Like the thing that we never thought would

00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:39.300
ever, ever, ever go away is the mythical

00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:39.880
man month.

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:42.940
Um, you know, nine women can't have a

00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:43.660
baby in a month.

00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:46.980
Well, with AI, you can, um, you know,

00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:50.300
with software, it's a metaphor for software.

00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:51.480
It's a metaphor for software.

00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:52.160
Yes, exactly.

00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:52.980
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:54.480
Uh, so in the old days, right?

00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:57.040
Like no matter how many engineers you put

00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:59.220
on a team, you still, you know, more

00:46:59.220 --> 00:46:59.600
engineers

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:01.840
would actually slow down the project as opposed

00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:02.540
to speed it up.

00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:04.900
But now, uh, so you couldn't throw money

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:06.280
at a problem.

00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:09.660
You couldn't throw money at somebody's technological lead.

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:11.060
You'd have to do something different.

00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:13.400
Um, now you can throw money at it.

00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:15.600
Uh, uh, you know, Elon did an amazing

00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:18.500
job of throwing money, um, at the foundation

00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:18.760
model

00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:20.380
problem and he caught up very, very fast.

00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:23.000
And that's something that in the whole history

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:24.780
of our industry could never have happened before.

00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:28.480
So if you had asked an AI, if

00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:31.340
Elon had any prayer of catching, um, open

00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:32.580
AI or anthropic,

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:33.880
they would have said no way.

00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:37.420
Uh, and so that's where you're getting into.

00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:39.940
Um, I mean, maybe if the AI was

00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:42.120
smart enough, I suppose, but like there, there

00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:42.600
are these,

00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:44.540
a lot of it has to do with

00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:45.720
like, how much do you believe in the

00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:46.040
person?

00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:47.400
Yeah.

00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:48.480
And then, and then the other part is

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:49.580
what we talked about already, but it's, it's

00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:50.540
the long and twisting path.

00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:51.860
You know, the investment's just the beginning.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:52.040
Right.

00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:53.360
And it's the long and twisting path that

00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:54.860
that person and that company take over time,

00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:55.440
um,

00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:56.520
and all the different ways that we, you

00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:57.620
know, we try to try to try to

00:47:57.620 --> 00:47:58.180
help them succeed.

00:47:58.300 --> 00:47:59.620
And so I, I think that, yeah, I,

00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:01.900
yeah, if yes, I, I don't know how

00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:02.720
to have AI do all that.

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:04.240
Um, but maybe we'll figure it out.

00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:04.660
Yeah.

00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:06.780
Uh, you, you could imagine an AI who

00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:07.300
could do it all.

00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:08.900
Of course, if an AI was smart about

00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:12.940
every single thing, including human psychology, then certainly.

00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:14.020
Could be.

00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:16.960
You're, you're, you're tasked with training this AI.

00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:18.180
Like what are the things that you've learned

00:48:18.180 --> 00:48:19.300
on this art that you can put into

00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:19.720
words?

00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:21.060
Like if it is, and this is the

00:48:21.060 --> 00:48:22.660
most optimistic view of the future I can

00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:23.360
think of, the tools

00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:25.360
are getting better, but the human piece really,

00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:25.820
really matters.

00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:28.040
Like what have you learned about the art

00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:29.460
that you can, that you can describe?

00:48:29.620 --> 00:48:31.140
Like, what do you look for in, in

00:48:31.140 --> 00:48:31.800
a Christopher Columbus?

00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:34.720
Well, I mean, I think that, um, the

00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:36.700
first thing, and I, you know, I hesitate

00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:37.960
to, to name things

00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:39.840
in, in some sense, cause they're also different,

00:48:39.940 --> 00:48:40.100
right?

00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:42.320
Like Elon is really not at all.

00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:44.020
Like, uh, Mark Zuckerberg.

00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:44.660
Who's not at all.

00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:45.580
Like Ali Goetze.

00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:48.300
Who's not like at all.

00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:49.220
Like Brian Chesky.

00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:50.840
So like, like they're all different.

00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:55.360
Um, and the, but the things that they

00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:58.860
all do, I would say is, um, they

00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:00.280
all think for themselves.

00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:02.020
They're not people who read the room and

00:49:02.020 --> 00:49:03.620
try and like figure out what people want

00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:03.920
them to

00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:04.060
do.

00:49:04.220 --> 00:49:07.040
They, they, they have original ideas.

00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:09.720
So original idea is probably the thing that

00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:12.260
every great entrepreneur has their original

00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:12.640
thinkers.

00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:18.900
Um, and then, you know, they, they all

00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:25.000
also have some combination of enough charisma.

00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:28.780
They're interesting enough, um, that people want to

00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:29.360
follow them.

00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:33.060
Um, because, you know, ultimately you, you kind

00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:35.660
of need people to go, okay, that is

00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:36.120
the leader.

00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:37.740
And that's somebody who I want to work

00:49:37.740 --> 00:49:39.100
with, work for, and so forth.

00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:42.240
Uh, so that's, those are the things that

00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:43.960
I would say almost all of them have.

00:49:44.100 --> 00:49:46.200
And then, and I think all of them

00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:47.300
have those to be great.

00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:51.520
Uh, but everything else, I, you know, like

00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:53.340
Steve Jobs is a very different kind of

00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:53.600
guy.

00:49:53.900 --> 00:49:56.380
Um, they're all, they're all different.

00:49:56.620 --> 00:49:58.300
I would say very, like Steve Jobs, nothing

00:49:58.300 --> 00:49:59.680
like Andy Grove, like nothing.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.160
Uh, but you know, they're both great.

00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:04.580
To close this out, I guess, from, from

00:50:04.580 --> 00:50:06.360
each of you, what is the thing that

00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:06.960
you're personally

00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:08.520
most excited about in the next kind of

00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:10.300
couple of years of a 16 Z, but

00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:11.580
just tech more broadly?

00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:13.840
Well, I mean, I mean, you know, you

00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:15.840
know, Mark, Mark had a great line.

00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:17.480
Like, well, this is on the order of

00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:19.900
like the steam engine or electricity or like,

00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:20.320
like this

00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:24.380
is such a big invention, um, that we're

00:50:24.380 --> 00:50:25.520
gonna end up in a different world.

00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:29.120
And the thing that's most exciting to me

00:50:29.120 --> 00:50:31.940
about it is, you know, I, I wouldn't

00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:32.480
want to live

00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:33.840
in the pre-electricity world.

00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:36.340
Um, like I like this world way, way,

00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:36.940
way better.

00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:40.260
And so I think that like odds are,

00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:42.080
we're gonna get to a world that's just

00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:43.400
way, way better than

00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:45.780
we can even like, we can't even get

00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:47.180
our heads around it, which is why it

00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:47.960
freaks people out.

00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:50.920
Like all these stuff that we have to

00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:53.100
do and so forth that we've just learned

00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:54.340
to live with that sucks,

00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:56.800
um, isn't gonna be required anymore.

00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:59.000
And so like, you know, what does that

00:50:59.000 --> 00:50:59.300
mean?

00:50:59.540 --> 00:51:00.680
What do we think of them?

00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:02.300
Like what is life become?

00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:05.580
It could be, uh, you know, super exciting.

00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:08.480
Now, the one thing with humans, that's a

00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:11.280
little messed up is, you know, if that

00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:12.600
takes us too far away,

00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:14.260
like one of the, you know, too far

00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:19.580
away from some grounded purpose, uh, about, um,

00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:21.520
you know, and

00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:24.920
beliefs, uh, and spirituality, then, you know, you

00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:26.600
can attach on to some dumb stuff.

00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:29.540
Uh, so, you know, that, that, that would

00:51:29.540 --> 00:51:31.080
be actually my only worry, but I think

00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:31.640
life just

00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:33.820
the quality of life for everybody's about to

00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:35.680
get like way, way better than it's ever

00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:35.880
been.

00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:37.920
I'm excited about the zoomers.

00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:42.780
I am psyched for the zoomers.

00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:44.760
Um, I was with a, uh, I was

00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:46.400
with a, uh, a founder, a founder team

00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:46.800
the other day.

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:48.840
Um, and, uh, I was, who are zoomers

00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:50.340
and I was explaining to them, you know,

00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:51.500
why the zoomers are so much better than

00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:52.840
the millennials and why they're gonna save us.

00:51:52.900 --> 00:51:53.760
And like, the whole thing is gonna be

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:53.960
great.

00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:54.520
This is so great.

00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:56.180
And of course, they're just like staring at

00:51:56.180 --> 00:51:58.000
me, like I'm speaking Greek because like they

00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.740
did, you know, they're, you know, they're, you

00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:00.860
know, they just think like millennials are like

00:52:00.860 --> 00:52:02.060
old farts that are like completely out of

00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:02.280
touch.

00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:05.240
Um, and of course, you know, us, Ben

00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:06.260
and I are Gen Xers, we might as

00:52:06.260 --> 00:52:07.160
well be, you know, Stone Age.

00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:08.800
Um, and, and I was like, but I

00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:10.240
was like, but I was like, this is

00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:11.100
what's so great about the zoomers.

00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:13.420
Like they just like, they're, they're, it's, it's

00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:15.540
the, it's the post that I would describe

00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:18.320
it as 2015 to 2024 was just, it

00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:19.840
was a very, very strange period.

00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:22.140
Um, and a lot of just things got

00:52:22.140 --> 00:52:22.700
really weird.

00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:25.960
Um, and the zoomers are the generation that

00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:27.500
basically was on the receiving end of that.

00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:29.880
And I, they're at least for the zoomers

00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:31.080
we get to deal with, like, they're just

00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:32.100
not having it.

00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:34.280
Um, and they're not walking around feeling guilty

00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:35.100
about everything all the time.

00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:36.700
They're not feeling like they have to like

00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:37.820
deny that they want to be successful.

00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:39.300
You know, they don't have any of the

00:52:39.300 --> 00:52:40.740
moral, you know, kind of hair shirt stuff.

00:52:41.020 --> 00:52:42.660
Um, they're, they're just like, they're there.

00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:44.700
If anything, they were like that too.

00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:46.400
Gen X kind of let go of all

00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:49.300
the craziness of the sixties and early seventies.

00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:50.580
Yeah, that's right.

00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:50.960
That's right.

00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:51.800
You're right.

00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:52.100
Exactly.

00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:53.420
Gen X was the reaction of the boomers

00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:54.720
in the same way the zoomers are reaction

00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:55.140
to the millennials.

00:52:55.420 --> 00:52:57.300
Um, and so the, the, the zoomer founders

00:52:57.300 --> 00:52:58.780
that we get to deal with, I, my

00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:00.280
view is like, it's the best, it's the

00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:02.620
best, it's the best, most competent, most capable.

00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:04.660
By the way, they're just like incredibly well,

00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:06.960
they come in all just incredibly well trained

00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:08.260
and indicated because they grew up online.

00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:09.860
You know, they've seen, you know, a thousand

00:53:09.860 --> 00:53:11.540
hours of YouTube videos from all the great,

00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:12.920
you know, people in tech talking about how

00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:13.420
to do everything.

00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:15.000
You know, they just know so much more

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.480
than previous generations of founders did.

00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:18.440
Um, and you know, they're, by the way,

00:53:18.580 --> 00:53:19.680
they're, now they're all AI native.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.300
Um, you know, they all, you know, basically

00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:22.680
learned AI from scratch and, you know, in

00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:24.480
college and, you know, they're coming out and

00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:25.840
they, they totally understand it.

00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:28.280
Um, and so, and they're just like tremendously

00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:30.440
fired up and like completely, you know, completely,

00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:32.780
you know, they wear their, you know, they

00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:33.480
wear the heart on their sleeve.

00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:35.040
They're like, they're, they're gonna build something, they're

00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:35.580
gonna build something great.

00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:37.080
And they're completely unapologetic about it.

00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:38.480
Uh, they're very forceful.

00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:39.080
They're very determined.

00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:41.180
Um, yeah, I, I, I just think it's

00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:41.460
fantastic.

00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:42.580
I, I've been waiting this bit.

00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:43.580
Eric and Ben will tell you, I've been

00:53:43.580 --> 00:53:46.660
waiting for this, uh, for, for a long

00:53:46.660 --> 00:53:46.960
time.

00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:49.440
We may have to edit this out, but

00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:50.920
one of the things I do really like

00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:51.580
about the Zoomers,

00:53:51.660 --> 00:53:55.080
I haven't ever heard anybody say anything like,

00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:57.200
I'm gonna do well by doing good.

00:53:57.760 --> 00:53:58.120
Exactly.

00:53:58.520 --> 00:53:59.540
Like they never fucking say that bullshit.

00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:00.720
No, no.

00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:01.620
None of that stuff.

00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:02.120
And they have a good sense of humor

00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:02.340
too.

00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:02.940
They're funny.

00:54:02.940 --> 00:54:03.480
Yes.

00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:04.020
Yes.

00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:04.780
They're extremely funny.

00:54:04.900 --> 00:54:05.440
Well, they're extremely funny.

00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:06.000
They get, they get it.

00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:07.140
They get, they, they lived through, they were

00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:08.440
on the receiving end of just a tremendous

00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:08.660
amount

00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:09.020
of bullshit.

00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:10.620
And they're just like, they're just not having

00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:10.780
it.

00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:13.160
Um, and so it's just, I find it

00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:14.980
just like tremendously exciting, uh, to, to be

00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:15.120
able to

00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:15.480
work with them.

00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:16.900
And I, um, I, if, if I, if

00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:18.700
I had total control over my time, it

00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:19.320
would be a hundred percent.

00:54:19.420 --> 00:54:19.840
That was the worst.

00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:22.740
Well, I appreciate you spending an hour with

00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:23.280
a millennial.

00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:24.500
This was a ton of fun.

00:54:24.980 --> 00:54:26.200
Thank you for letting me write about, uh,

00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:28.580
about A16Z and thanks for, thanks for the

00:54:28.580 --> 00:54:29.000
conversation.

00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:31.300
We're, we're talking about all your future guests.

00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:32.260
Yeah, exactly.

00:54:32.260 --> 00:54:32.800
Yeah.

00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:35.000
Vacci, this was an excellent piece.

00:54:35.140 --> 00:54:36.140
Thank you so much for writing.

00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:36.560
Yeah.

00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:36.800
Yeah.

00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:37.080
Yes.
