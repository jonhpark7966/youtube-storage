1
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,340
NEO can now turn any prompt into autonomous

2
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,980
action. With the latest update to the 1X

3
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,740
World Model, NEO learns from internet-scale data

4
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,440
and applies it to the real world.

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,760
By visualizing future actions with a video model

6
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,780
grounded in physics, NEO can generalize to new

7
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,700
tasks it's never seen before. This opens a

8
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:41,640
new path for robotics learning, one where robots

9
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,280
learn by teaching themselves, using the data they

10
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,740
generated on their own, and grow in AI

11
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,880
capabilities alongside the rapidly improving video models.

12
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,080
Our world model is pre-trained on web

13
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,480
-scale video data that captures human interaction, and

14
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,860
then post-trained on robot data to ground

15
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:07,000
that understanding in real-world physics and NEO's

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,580
humanoid embodiment. This allows NEO to visualize future

17
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,320
actions and use a built-in inverse dynamics

18
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,480
model to turn those visualizations into movement.

19
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,040
Today, we'll use the world model as NEO's

20
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,760
cognitive core to execute autonomous action sequences several

21
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,400
seconds long.

22
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,720
How it works is you'll give NEO a

23
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,480
prompt with voice or text. For this example,

24
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,420
I'll use the world model desktop interface to

25
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,880
illustrate how it comes together. And start with

26
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,480
something simple, like having NEO pack this orange

27
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,700
into the lunchbox.

28
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,760
Once you prompt NEO, it'll take what it

29
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,600
sees as input to generate a visualization of

30
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,480
how to complete the request. As you can

31
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,000
see on the screen below, NEO is visualizing

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,280
how to perform this task using its world

33
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:57,580
model.

34
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,880
You can either have NEO automatically execute the

35
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,180
generation or choose the best one to run

36
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:05,400
from among several parallel generations.

37
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,000
While NEO has never seen these objects before,

38
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,440
there are still some examples of pick and

39
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,200
place tasks in our dataset. So one might

40
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,440
assume it's generalizing to a similar task to

41
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,480
create this visualization.

42
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,240
But this is not the case. With the

43
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,140
world model, NEO can perform any task with

44
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:31,040
any object, whether there is existing data or

45
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,280
not.

46
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,560
Not only has NEO never seen this toilet,

47
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,660
but it has never performed a task anywhere

48
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,480
near similar. Without any prior data on how

49
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,860
to operate a toilet seat, the transfer of

50
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:47,020
human knowledge becomes a lot more apparent.

51
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,000
The world model is also really useful for

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,700
handling unpredictable environments.

53
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,720
Traditional AI models for robots are often overly

54
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,680
sensitive to the surroundings, like changes in lighting

55
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,060
or even random objects in the environment.

56
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,560
NEO's world model, by contrast, applies human knowledge

57
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,580
of how to navigate highly dynamic settings to

58
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,100
handle even the most extreme changes in environment.

59
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,200
Given a world model can generate just about

60
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,740
anything you can imagine, there is no limit

61
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,520
to what NEO can try and execute autonomously.

62
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,120
While NEO's world model is trusted, they are

63
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,700
consistentlyendre learning and successful watches in activity momento

64
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:37,740
inbetween.

65
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,940
We still have work to do to increase

66
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,040
the length and success rate of each generated

67
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:04,500
ability

68
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,960
to make the world model more useful.

69
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,840
But with the world model, NEO can create

70
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,940
unlimited data of itself doing real-world tasks,

71
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,620
creating a flywheel that enables NEO to teach

72
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:19,980
itself anything, marking a true paradigm shift in

73
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,600
AI and robotics.
