WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400
So level 1. Alright, google.com. Here's the

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.160
logo. Here's the search bar. Oh, and here's

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.700
the buttons. Why are you still waiting? Well,

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.600
it's because you were missing this. This little

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.200
line of text at the bottom. See, when

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.720
Google launched, it was incredibly minimalistic compared to

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.920
all the other search engines out there. But

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.620
because of this, they had a problem. When

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.460
they started making user tests in the early

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.500
2000s with Stanford students, the students would sit

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.680
there for 45 seconds staring at the page

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.160
waiting for it to finish loading,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.840
even though it was fully loading. And that's

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.360
because all the information. And that's because all

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.920
the information was at the top. So how

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.540
did they fix it? Well, with this. A

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.600
copyright notice that has no legal need to

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.620
be there, but it was put there only

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.260
to let you know that the page has

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.180
finished loading. See, this is only level 1

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.520
of the 7 levels of the insane rabbit

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.040
hole that is designing and building tech products.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.240
And these levels are what makes the difference

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.600
between products that feel really bad, that you

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.020
hate using, and products that end up generating

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.080
billions of billions of dollars in revenue, and

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.640
that end up changing the world. We're going

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.800
to go from uncovering the smallest details to

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.800
the entire product strategies of some of the

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.840
biggest tech companies in the world. But even

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.880
here at level 1, there's so much more

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.020
that you don't see behind the tech that

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.760
you use every day. Take a look at

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.000
this. This is a nice rounded interface. So

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.460
here for these checkboxes, we're going to match

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.240
the style, we're going to make them round.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.500
But now you see that there's a problem.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.420
The app feels broken. And that's because by

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.380
making these round,

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.000
we made them look like something else that

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.160
we're used to. Radio buttons, where you can

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.520
only select one option at a time. This

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.720
super small difference in how rounded these boxes

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.500
are completely changed how we interpret what we

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.940
see and what we think we can do

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.680
in this screen. And that's because we have

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.860
this knowledge in our brain that got reinforced

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.380
over thousands of times using technology that this

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.600
means only one option and this means that

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.060
you can have many. Or take a look

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.000
at this. Well, of course, this is a

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.260
link

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.500
to something. Duh. Well, no. Turns out it

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.020
was just some blue underlined text. And the

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.340
reason this fell off is that we were

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.980
missing this. The mouse cursor changing from the

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:12.140
regular arrow to the little hand that says,

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.180
hey, there's an action here. This might seem

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.820
like a small detail, but without this, our

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.460
interfaces would be completely unusable. Like, for example,

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.440
trying to drag some panel without the cursor

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.240
becoming their size one. Without this small visual

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.640
detail on your cursor, you simply wouldn't be

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.180
able to use any desktop computer,

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.340
and that's why this has been around from

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.780
the beginning since 1987, when it was invented

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.460
by Bill Atkinson for the Macintosh app HyperCard.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.640
And it's stuck around to this day. Oh,

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.520
and all these interactions that you're seeing, I

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.000
build them as full working prototypes using Magic

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.980
Patterns, the sponsor of this video. More about

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.560
it later. But take a look at these.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.040
These are files on your computer, but the

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.900
file names are really long. Now, usually when

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.900
you have a really, really long string on

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.280
an app, this happens. It gets cut and

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.400
these dots, which are called ellipses, appear to

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.040
tell you that, hey,

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.600
there's more. But now, with this, we cannot

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.840
see which one is the file version, for

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.360
example. Say, v1 or v2, which usually is

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.180
stuff that's at the end of the file

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.720
name. We cannot put the ellipses at the

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.240
beginning either, because otherwise we lose the file

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.920
name more together.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.120
So, for example, here in macOS, when we

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.660
try to reduce the size of the window,

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.920
the file names get the ellipses in the

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.760
center, and letters get progressively cheaped away on

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.940
each side of the ellipses centered in the

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.260
word. So you can see the start of

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.700
the file name and the end of the

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:26.120
file name.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.420
So this means that someone had to manually

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.920
go in and write all the code that

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.660
calculates how many letters to chip away at

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.420
each side of the ellipses just to make

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.440
sure this happens.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.360
By the way, that someone is Scott Jensen,

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.800
who built this, again, for Apple in the

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.200
80s.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.400
See, designing tech is not just about making

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.520
things look nice. These seemingly small visual details

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.160
won't get noticed by 99% of people,

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.960
but it's what makes our tech usable.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.080
But yeah, sometimes they are there just because

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.500
they're fun. Like, for example, you drag the

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.620
Google Street View yellow guy, and you can

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.500
see that he's actually holding on to the

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.860
cursor and reacting to gravity as you move

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:00.240
him around.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.220
Why? Well, why not?

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.000
And now let's start to go up a

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.440
level, because that's when things start to get

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.780
interesting.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.360
So say you're on a call with your

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.440
bank. They're telling you there is a suspicious

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.300
activity on your account, and they need to

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.420
verify some information.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.360
So you open your banking app to check,

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.300
and you see, this, Revolut, is not calling

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.500
you.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.640
The people that built this app made it

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.400
so that it's detecting when you're on a

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.060
phone call and when you're opening the app

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.740
at the same time.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.620
And because one of the most common scams

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.360
is someone pretending to be your bank and

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.900
asking you to do something in the app

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.420
while they're on the phone with you,

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.340
Do not read it! Do not read in

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.780
the card!

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.780
Revolut just tells you. Whoever's on the phone,

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.940
well, it's not us.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.180
And this is what Level 2 is all

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.260
about. It's not just how things look.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.700
It's the interactions and how they behave.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.200
And more importantly, it's about building behaviors that

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.180
feel human.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.480
Like take Google Maps. Your phone has a

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.940
touchscreen, and it's perfect for moving around this

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:54.180
map.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.700
You can just drag your finger around.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.200
But zooming in still requires you to pinch

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.080
the screen, so it requires two hands.

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.460
We're usually trying to navigate around. We're on

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.840
a bike.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.340
It's the worst possible time to require us

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:06.060
to pinch stuff.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.740
So you end up doing this weird contortionism

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:09.720
just to zoom in.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.280
But actually, in Google Maps, you can double

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.820
tap and hold and drag your finger up

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.660
and down to zoom in and out with

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:16.240
one finger.

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.220
You can actually do it in almost all

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.240
the applications where you can pinch to zoom.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.620
The first time I learned about this, I

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.220
was like, I'm sorry, what?

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.280
But the problem with this is that while

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.600
it definitely goes into the genius category, there

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.380
is no way to know that you can

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:30.200
actually do this.

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.320
Most people don't even know, but one interaction

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.800
that instead gets used billions of times every

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.060
single day is this.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.740
You know, when you drag down the top

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:38.720
of a list to refresh.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.040
This interaction is incredibly intuitive, and it removes

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.080
the need for an additional refresh button.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.240
But while this looks totally innocuous, today this

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.020
feature is used by the biggest social media

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.920
companies on the planet,

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.760
paired with infinite scrolling feeds, like Instagram, to

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:55.040
show you something new every time you refresh.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.460
And this one simple interaction is probably responsible

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.160
for billions of dollars of revenue in ads

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.940
on these feeds.

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.640
But now, let's go up a level once

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.860
again, because in 2008, music streaming had a

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:07.140
problem.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.440
Piracy was everywhere.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.900
People were illegally downloading songs all over the

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:11.140
place.

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.000
And if I wanted to purchase my entire

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.240
current Spotify library legally on iTunes back then,

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.220
it would have run me $3,800.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.060
And I would have to synchronize all these

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.060
songs manually on all of my devices.

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.960
And that's when Spotify came in.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.120
But they had a problem.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.820
See, they started with this promise of instant

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:28.780
music streaming.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.260
Just choose a track and immediately listen to

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:31.400
it.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.400
But the problem is that internet speeds back

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.980
then, especially mobile, weren't anywhere near as fast

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:37.640
as they are today.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.220
They tried what anyone would.

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.280
Just host the songs on their servers, and

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.640
anytime someone needs a song, just stream it

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:44.480
down to the device.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.120
And it was atrocious.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.240
It could take from 30 seconds to a

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:50.560
full minute for a song to start playing.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:51.880
So that's when they had an idea.

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.000
They bought a company that actually powered piracy.

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:57.540
And that you might remember called uTorrent.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.380
And sold uTorrent almost immediately.

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:01.140
But the reason they did this is to

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:03.020
get this one guy.

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:04.420
Ludwig Strigus.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.920
And he rebuilt Spotify's infrastructure at the time

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.540
using the same technology that powered piracy.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:10.220
Peer to peer.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.600
See, when you play the song, it came

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.880
from three places at once.

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.700
Spotify servers, your own cash, and other Spotify

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:16.600
users near you.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.160
A 2010 study found that only 8.8

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.520
% of the music came from Spotify servers.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.040
36% came from other users, and the

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.620
rest was smartly downloaded already on your device.

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:28.880
They took the exact technology that the music

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.420
industry were suing people over, and used it

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:32.940
to build a legal alternative.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.940
And as a user, you never noticed.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.540
You just clicked on a song, and it

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:38.780
worked.

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.460
See, most people think that great products are

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.120
built around great technology.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.480
But most of the times, it's the opposite

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.180
that happens.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:46.740
You have a great idea for how the

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:49.220
perfect interaction and experience looks like, and then

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.480
you find the technology that makes it possible.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.780
Because the ones that really matter are those

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:56.040
that make incredible experiences possible.

00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:59.240
But also where the technology disappears, and you

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.340
never see it.

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:02.060
But as we get to level 4, this

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:03.200
is where we start to get into the

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.660
really powerful laws that control how tech products

00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:06.920
are designed and built.

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:08.820
And how they can also be used to

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:09.520
manipulate you.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.220
So you just finished an episode on Netflix.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:14.520
The usual cliffhanger, credits roll, and three, two,

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.220
what?

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.660
The next episode already started.

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:18.780
See, this was an example of level 4

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:19.520
product design.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.660
And it's something that seems small, but it's

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.300
incredibly powerful to control the behavior of millions

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:24.940
of users.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:27.320
Both in a good and in a bad

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:27.580
way.

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:28.760
Defaults.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.820
Oh look, I got ghosted by a 10

00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:32.380
out of 10 on both iMessage and WhatsApp.

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.200
Now, other than the fact that I need

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.840
more res, there's something else going on here.

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:39.680
On WhatsApp, read receipts are on by default.

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.820
But on iMessage, you instead choose if you

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:42.440
want them or not.

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:44.180
Which for the most part would mean that

00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:45.280
people turn them off.

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:47.720
Since when presented with the choice, users tend

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:49.360
to choose the option that gives out less

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.040
information about them on average.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.880
Now, this might seem like a small difference.

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.700
But since most people never change their settings,

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.620
this creates completely different social dynamics.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.580
On WhatsApp, seen without a reply is bloated.

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:04.000
You saw my message.

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.360
Why didn't you respond?

00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.100
On iMessage, nobody knows if you read it.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:11.260
Same feature, different default, different relationship.

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.160
This is called default bias.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.360
And it's not just in your tech.

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.180
This is a chart of the percentage of

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:19.480
organ donors in different European countries.

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:21.660
Try to guess what is the difference between

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:23.380
the first and the second group.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:26.860
Well, the only difference is the default choice.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.940
In Austria, the default is to donate.

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.820
And you opt out of donating.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.760
Well, in Denmark, you need to opt in

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:33.440
to donate.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.200
And this is, well, default bias.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.700
But here is where defaults become worth billions

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:39.400
of dollars.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.500
Have you ever wondered why did Google buy

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:41.920
Android?

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.840
Spent billions to make it a worldwide mobile

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.000
operating system only to give it away for

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:47.360
free?

00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:49.220
Or why did they build Chrome?

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.900
Well, not because they love making browsers or

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:52.740
operating systems,

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:56.200
but because whoever controls the platform can set

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.100
the defaults,

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.260
including the search engine which they set to

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.020
Google, where they make their money.

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:02.960
And for the devices they don't control, Google

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.360
pays Apple $20 billion a year

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.360
just to be the default option on Safari.

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.140
They estimated that they would lose 60%

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.100
to 80% of iPhone search traffic if

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:11.860
they didn't do this.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.300
Not because people would switch to Bing, but

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.880
because people just use whatever is already there.

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:19.860
Now, see all these examples and visuals that

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:21.300
I've shown you in this very video.

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:24.780
Well, these are real working components made with

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:27.120
the sponsor of this video, Magic Patterns,

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.400
because it's built exactly for this.

00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.020
See, Magic Patterns is not about building entire

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:33.000
apps from scratch,

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:35.460
but it's about allowing builders like me to

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:36.860
quickly try different designs,

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:40.260
iterations and components with natural language just by

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:40.600
chatting.

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:42.660
If you notice, all the examples I made

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:44.440
in this video were also in the same

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.180
visual style.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:47.200
And that's because with Magic Patterns, you can

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.160
set your product's styling, colors and visuals,

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.340
and have it follow it when prototyping.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.540
You can even upload screenshots as a reference

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:56.160
to guide the AI towards what you're envisioning.

00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.020
Once you're happy with something, you can export

00:10:58.020 --> 00:10:58.760
it straight to Figma,

00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:00.980
sync it to GitHub, or deploy it to

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:01.680
a custom domain.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:03.260
If you're working with a team, there's a

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.220
shared canvas for real-time collaboration.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:07.360
You can join the army of designers, engineers,

00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.720
thinkers, and product teams,

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:10.920
or the using Magic Patterns with the link

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:11.740
in the description,

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:13.520
which also gives the viewers of my channel

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:14.860
a nice little discount.

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:16.480
But now, let's go back to the video,

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.480
because now that we get to level 5,

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:21.000
we start to blur the boundaries between product

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.320
design and product strategy.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.760
And this is where you start to see

00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.560
the more important product decisions that shape how

00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.560
we use something.

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:29.340
So, let me show you how I personally

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:32.000
used level 5 to build this.

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:33.400
This is Flask.

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:35.740
It's my own company and my own product.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.440
It's a video collaboration tool where you can

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.320
collaborate on videos,

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:40.000
record comments, and share your screen.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.740
And all of the comments appear visually right

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:42.540
on the video's timeline.

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:44.240
Now, for every comment, we need to give

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.640
out key information that we cannot miss.

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:49.060
For example, who created the comment, Enrico in

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:49.400
this case,

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.760
when this was added, or which timestamp it's

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:52.740
referencing in the video.

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:54.180
You also need a way to mark the

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:54.900
comment as done.

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:57.620
Now, the most basic approach that any designer

00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:59.120
would take is this.

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:00.900
Find a nice way to get them out,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:01.860
and you're done.

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:04.100
For example, this is what my main competitor

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:04.480
does.

00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.000
You have all the info right here, and

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.460
you can mark a comment as done right

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:07.720
there.

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.540
But instead, what if we take a level

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:11.480
5 strategic approach to this,

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.380
where we don't just think about how to

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:14.560
arrange things visually,

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.940
but how to architect the logic of the

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:19.440
entire app to make this all much more

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:19.940
elegant.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.240
For example, instead of deciding that this is

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:23.180
a done toggle,

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:25.380
why don't we create the general purpose tagging

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:25.720
system,

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.060
where each element can have custom tags.

00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:30.300
And then we'll create a default one called

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:30.760
done,

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:32.020
and another one called important.

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:33.540
So we can show users that you can

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:35.300
actually have more than one at a time.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.080
And now, these are not fixed in place.

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.680
If you don't like done, and you want

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:39.600
to use it for something else,

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:40.920
you can just delete it.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.720
But as people started to request more and

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:43.320
more features,

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.100
they wanted to be able to filter by

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:45.460
user,

00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:47.860
or by custom tag, or by creation date,

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.820
and it was getting so complicated.

00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:52.260
So instead, we're going to make one structural

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:53.320
design change,

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.640
and say that everything is a tag.

00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:57.660
So now the creator becomes a tag.

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.280
The creation time becomes a tag.

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.740
Even the link timestamp becomes a tag.

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:03.980
Now, these are not editable by the user,

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.360
but watch what happens.

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:07.140
Now I can create a filtering system

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:09.620
that filters by multiple types of tags in

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:10.320
the same place,

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.240
and it all feels logical.

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.920
Now I don't need to have a dedicated

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.680
row up top with its own layout.

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:17.740
I can just have a list of tags.

00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.080
And now, a while later,

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:20.540
I had to build a system to notify

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:22.740
users of new comments that got added

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:24.120
since they last visited.

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.020
Normally, I would have to create an entirely

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:26.600
new view

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.880
to show these comments.

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:30.240
But now that we made this structural design

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:30.680
decision

00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.420
that everything is a tag,

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:33.680
you can see that I just need to

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.000
add a tag called new to the comments.

00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.280
And clicking here will just trigger a filter

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.420
for that tag,

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:41.760
which uses all the existing stuff that we

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:42.620
already built before.

00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:44.900
Having a great structural design in the logic

00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.000
of how your app works

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.440
makes everything else simpler.

00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.180
That's why in a similar way to Flask,

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.560
Notion took the decision to make everything a

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:52.820
page.

00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:54.700
Even though it might be displayed as a

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.080
calendar or a feed or a table,

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.260
everything is a page.

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:59.600
Or while Slack decided that everything is a

00:13:59.600 --> 00:13:59.880
channel.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.440
These are all examples of level 5.

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.660
But at level 6 is where we start

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:05.860
to leave product design

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:07.540
as you think about it and start to

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:09.660
enter the realm of product strategy.

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.000
See, for example, video has been around forever.

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:13.600
You can record yourself on your phone.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:14.880
You can have a video call on Zoom.

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:15.860
You can upload to YouTube.

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:17.060
Video is soft.

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:18.660
We don't need any more video products.

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:21.120
But then Loom came along and said,

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.980
what if video wasn't for entertainment or for

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:24.560
live calls,

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:26.480
but for replacing meetings?

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:28.340
What if instead of scheduling 30 minutes with

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:28.740
your team,

00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:30.980
you just record a 3-minute video and

00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:31.540
send it out?

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:33.380
They didn't invent video.

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:34.540
They didn't invent recording.

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:35.680
They didn't invent players.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.980
They reframed what video is for.

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:40.620
And this little reframe built a company that

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:43.600
Atlassian bought for $975 million.

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.660
Or take Superhuman.

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:47.440
Email has been around for decades.

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:48.500
Gmail is free.

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:50.760
What could you possibly do here?

00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:54.300
Well, Superhuman reframed email from inbox you need

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:54.760
to manage

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:57.780
to the fastest email out there.

00:14:57.780 --> 00:14:59.820
They added keyboard shortcuts for everything.

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:01.540
They show you how long it takes to

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:02.760
get through your inbox.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.160
They gamified going to inbox zero.

00:15:05.340 --> 00:15:07.680
And that's how they charge $30 a month

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:08.100
for it.

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:09.840
This is what level 6 is all about.

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:11.220
The technology doesn't change.

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:12.320
The framing doesn't change.

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:13.860
Hell, the design might not even change.

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:15.600
But the right strategic decision here

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.160
can create billions of dollars worth of company.

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.560
And now we finally get to level 7.

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:23.260
This is Steve Jobs kind of territory.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.180
Get rid of all these buttons and just

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:27.260
make a giant screen.

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.560
See, at the time, this sounded insane.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:30.640
Blackberry was king.

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:32.160
Physical keyboards were essential.

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.360
The idea that you could type accurately on

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:34.740
a touchscreen

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:36.220
was considered fantasy.

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:37.260
And here's the thing.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.840
It wasn't even a new idea.

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:41.200
In 1984, a company called General Magic

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.380
spun off from Apple and shipped the Sonic

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:44.000
Magic Link,

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.680
a handheld device with a touchscreen

00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.780
where you could do email, calendar, notes,

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:51.160
the first smartphone 13 years before the iPhone.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.420
And it flopped.

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.980
So what is the difference here?

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.600
It's the same vision, the same bed,

00:15:55.900 --> 00:15:57.320
but a completely different outcome.

00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:59.540
The difference was everything underneath.

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:02.020
General Magic, just like Steve Jobs a few

00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:02.560
years later,

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:03.820
had level 7.

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.760
It's a crazy product vision.

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:07.540
Something that completely changes things.

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:10.060
But they didn't have all the layers underneath.

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.920
And the difference between Steve Jobs and the

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:12.420
iPhone team

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:15.240
and everyone else is all the levels underneath.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.560
It's going to level 6 and reframing the

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:17.800
phone

00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:19.180
from a device that makes calls

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:20.700
to a computer in your pocket.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.020
Not a phone with apps, but apps with

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:23.340
a phone.

00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.120
It's going back to level 5.

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.360
The structural decision that everything is an app,

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:30.380
no file system, no complex desktop-like UI,

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:33.860
everything is in this neat grid of apps.

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:36.080
It's going back to level 4, the defaults.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.220
The App Store ships with Apple's apps front

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:38.660
and center.

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:39.860
Safari defaults to Google.

00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.960
The home button always takes you home.

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:44.080
And of course, you need level 3,

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.100
the technical innovation.

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:47.440
Capacitive multi-touch that actually works.

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:48.900
Gorilla Glass that doesn't break.

00:16:49.060 --> 00:16:50.260
A battery that lasts a day.

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:51.460
And going back to level 2,

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:53.620
the interactions, inventing pinch to zoom,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:54.660
slide to unlock,

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.940
the rubber band bouncy feel when you scroll

00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:57.440
too far.

00:16:57.660 --> 00:16:59.020
And all the way to level 1,

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:01.160
the details, the squircles on every icon,

00:17:01.300 --> 00:17:02.180
the weight of the animation.

00:17:02.620 --> 00:17:04.720
And Ken Cosienta, an engineer with a deadline,

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:06.620
fingered out that you need to make

00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:08.480
the invisible hitboxes of the keyboard

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.700
dynamically bigger based on the letter you were

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:11.020
typing.

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:13.160
Otherwise, your keyboard wouldn't work.

00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.080
But what you saw is just the beginning.

00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:16.540
This video is part of a series

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:17.960
where we go behind the scenes of the

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:18.200
design,

00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:19.180
engineering, and psychology

00:17:19.180 --> 00:17:20.920
of the tech that we use every day.

00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:23.220
And how even things that look so simple

00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:23.760
and stupid

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.620
hide an absurd amount of complexity.

00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:27.580
And you can find the next video right

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:27.840
here.
