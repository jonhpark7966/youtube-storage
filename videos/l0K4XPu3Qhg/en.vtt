00:00:25.316 --> 00:00:27.652
So why does Altman seem so upset here?

00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:28.570
After all, this interviewer

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.158
was just pointing out a basic fact that OpenAI has committed to spend over $1

00:00:33.158 --> 00:00:36.995
trillion on AI infrastructure over the next eight years, despite only

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:40.915
bringing in around $13 billion a year in recurring revenue,

00:00:40.915 --> 00:00:44.044
less than 1% of what they're promising to spend.

00:00:44.294 --> 00:00:47.172
I'm no money genius- and I'm personally terrible

00:00:47.172 --> 00:00:50.175
at budgeting-but that doesn't seem great.

00:00:50.258 --> 00:00:52.302
Most of the supposed growth in the American

00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:55.889
economy in 2025 was caused by investment in AI.

00:00:56.139 --> 00:01:00.435
That's all part of a promise being made by the industry, led by Sam Altman,

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.439
that once a certain level of machine learning intelligence is reached,

00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:06.357
all of our problems will be solved.

00:01:06.608 --> 00:01:07.442
The housing crisis,

00:01:07.442 --> 00:01:07.901
cancer,

00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:08.443
poverty,

00:01:08.443 --> 00:01:09.027
climate change

00:01:09.027 --> 00:01:09.527
mental health,

00:01:09.527 --> 00:01:10.153
democracy,

00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:12.822
universal basic income care, a bunch of diseases, this cancer

00:01:12.822 --> 00:01:14.074
and that one, and heart disease

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:16.618
helping you try to accomplish your goals and be your best.

00:01:16.618 --> 00:01:17.702
Very high quality health care.

00:01:17.702 --> 00:01:19.370
The important new scientific discoveries

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.998
the marginal cost of energy are going to trend rapidly toward zero.

00:01:21.998 --> 00:01:24.542
The more equal world universal extreme health for everybody.

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:26.294
In exchange for all that

00:01:26.294 --> 00:01:30.215
Altman is asking all of society to put all of our eggs-our data,

00:01:30.381 --> 00:01:35.261
our economy, our water and resources... everything-into one basket:

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:38.348
his. He's offering us one, massive,

00:01:40.308 --> 00:01:42.060
So, should we trust Altman?

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.603
Should we accept his deal?

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:45.730
Is it even our choice?

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.108
Altman isn't a technologist or scientist,

00:01:48.108 --> 00:01:52.737
He's an investor and dealmaker and really good at it... supposedly.

00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:56.324
But his whole career is a series of 'just trust me, bro' moments.

00:01:56.741 --> 00:01:58.118
So let's examine the deal

00:01:58.118 --> 00:01:59.702
Altman is offering all of us.

00:01:59.702 --> 00:02:01.830
Should we believe Sam Altman's promises?

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.625
And what's the cost to the rest of us if those promises

00:02:05.625 --> 00:02:08.628
turn out to be... lies?

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.965
So let's go back and look closer

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:14.968
at Altman's early days in the tech industry.

00:02:15.176 --> 00:02:18.221
Altman's first big deal was selling his first company,

00:02:18.513 --> 00:02:21.933
Loopt a service for locating your friends.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.020
That's something that inherently needs lots of users to work, or else you're just

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:27.438
locating yourself.

00:02:27.605 --> 00:02:29.774
The operative idea seems to be ubiquity.

00:02:29.774 --> 00:02:33.736
I mean, get get it out there in more ways than you can possibly imagine.

00:02:37.532 --> 00:02:39.742
This whole time, Loopt refused to say how many users they had.

00:02:40.034 --> 00:02:42.912
Altman just insisted there were "way

00:02:42.912 --> 00:02:45.915
more users" than any other similar service.

00:02:45.957 --> 00:02:50.837
It turns out, though, that towards the end, Loopt only had 500 users.

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.883
When Reuters reported this, Altman insisted it was "100 times"

00:02:54.883 --> 00:02:58.553
more than that and that he'd provide evidence... He never did.

00:02:58.803 --> 00:03:00.847
Just trust me, bro.

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:03.349
Loopt sold to the Green Dot Corporation,

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:06.895
who shut it down immediately and never used any of the tech.

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:10.857
Green Dot investors allege it was a dirty deal done to enrich

00:03:10.857 --> 00:03:14.652
Sequoia Capital, a VC firm with a stake in Loopt

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.948
and two board members at Green Dot who helped approve the deal.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.951
Altman left Green Dot as soon as he was legally able,

00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:26.706
walking away with millions for building an app that no longer existed in any form.

00:03:26.998 --> 00:03:30.001
And luckily for Altman, someone saw something in him.

00:03:30.126 --> 00:03:34.464
Peter Thiel. Thiel, who once said that Altman should be treated as

00:03:34.672 --> 00:03:37.842
"more of a messiah figure" gave Altman millions

00:03:37.842 --> 00:03:40.887
to start his own VC firm, Hydrazine Capital.

00:03:41.763 --> 00:03:44.098
And that's not all the capital Altman controlled.

00:03:44.098 --> 00:03:47.936
He was also hired as president of Y Combinator, or YC,

00:03:47.936 --> 00:03:51.898
an influential venture capital firm and startup incubator,

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:55.568
where Loopt got its original funding. "I think the president of YC

00:03:55.777 --> 00:03:58.321
is sort of the unofficial leader of the startup movement."

00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:01.324
And Altman personally traded on that influence.

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:04.953
The New Yorker reports that up to 75% of Hydrazine

00:04:05.036 --> 00:04:08.039
Capital was invested in YC companies.

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:11.292
Altman used his inside view to get a cut of

00:04:11.292 --> 00:04:12.085
YC's power.

00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:16.172
Despite Altman promising he didn't cross invest in YC companies.

00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:20.176
That's two big lies so far: the user base of LOOPT

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:23.972
that needed users to exist, and his investments.

00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:28.977
In 2015, Altman leads YC into the investment you likely most know him for:

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:34.023
"Sort of a semi-company, semi-nonprofit, doing AI safety research."

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:39.362
OpenAI was launched as the supposed nonprofit OpenAI Foundation with a charter

00:04:39.362 --> 00:04:43.783
with a lot of lofty goals, "a primary fiduciary duty to humanity"

00:04:43.783 --> 00:04:47.161
and "avoiding enabling uses of AI or AGI

00:04:47.161 --> 00:04:50.164
that harm humanity or unduly concentrate power," while

00:04:50.331 --> 00:04:54.252
acting to "minimize conflicts of interest among our employees and stakeholders."

00:04:54.794 --> 00:04:57.880
The evidence that they'd do that? "Just trust me, bro."

00:04:58.631 --> 00:05:00.258
OpenAI's primary financial

00:05:00.258 --> 00:05:03.428
backers were tech billionaires and millionaires like Altman

00:05:03.428 --> 00:05:07.015
himself, Peter Thiel, Reid Hoffman and Elon Musk,

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.893
and tech companies like Amazon Web Services and Infosys.

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:14.522
We wanted to build this with humanity’s best interest at heart.

00:05:14.522 --> 00:05:17.025
But in exchange, OpenAI is asking for a lot...

00:05:17.025 --> 00:05:20.361
Putting all of society's eggs in one basket, if you will.

00:05:20.361 --> 00:05:24.866
They want electricity, water, infrastructure...

00:05:25.366 --> 00:05:26.284
Capital...

00:05:26.284 --> 00:05:29.120
Your data... Your writing... Your art...

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.290
And for humanity to adjust to job

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:35.251
loss, deepfakes and everything else.

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:40.381
All in exchange for some future promise of technology that fixes everything.

00:05:40.631 --> 00:05:43.259
So, can we trust him with all of this?

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:45.345
Let's look at some of his biggest statements

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:50.308
and promises to show how they tie to all the eggs in the basket.

00:05:50.725 --> 00:05:53.770
Altman insists he doesn't own any of OpenAI

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:56.314
and he barely takes a salary.

00:05:56.314 --> 00:05:58.691
I’m paid enough for health insurance. I have no equity in OpenAI.

00:05:58.691 --> 00:05:59.859
I'm doing this because I love it.

00:05:59.942 --> 00:06:02.403
But he doesn't hide that he's already rich

00:06:02.403 --> 00:06:05.531
trying to do a rich-guy-using money-for-good Batman thing.

00:06:05.823 --> 00:06:07.325
That Batman.

00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:09.285
Such a wonderful person.

00:06:09.285 --> 00:06:10.953
I don't deserve it.

00:06:10.953 --> 00:06:13.206
But we millionaires decided that you do.

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:16.751
But let's look at how this is part of his honesty problem.

00:06:16.834 --> 00:06:20.463
And it ties in to the eggs in the basket, because Altman is invested

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:23.841
in all the stuff necessary to build OpenAI.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.261
One of the eggs OpenAI needs is a ton of data:

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.265
you can't build a large language model without examples of language

00:06:31.265 --> 00:06:34.977
and content, and one source of that data is Reddit.

00:06:35.311 --> 00:06:35.978
Altman owns

00:06:35.978 --> 00:06:40.733
a big share of the social networking site and was on its board until 2022.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.695
Reddit got its start in the same inaugural Y Combinator class as Loopt.

00:06:45.113 --> 00:06:49.826
Here's Altman standing next to Reddit co-founder Aaron Swartz in 2005.

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:54.747
Swartz died by suicide in 2013 after being criminally charged

00:06:54.747 --> 00:07:00.044
for reproducing academic articles online and breaking copyright law.

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:04.048
In 2015., Altman made a deal with Reddit, allowing OpenAI to "basically

00:07:04.048 --> 00:07:08.636
aggressively scrape everything posted on the site" to feed into OpenAI's tech.

00:07:08.845 --> 00:07:13.307
Reddit co-founder Alex Ohanian "felt in his bones" the deal was wrong.

00:07:13.558 --> 00:07:16.436
It's a less noble version of what Reddit co-founder

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:19.522
Aaron Swartz was targeted by law enforcement for.

00:07:19.856 --> 00:07:22.859
Swartz wanted to open the knowledge up to everyone.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.903
Altman wanted to put it in his product.

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:29.449
In 2014, Altman promised that he and other investors

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:33.286
would give 10% of Reddit's value back to the Reddit community.

00:07:33.494 --> 00:07:37.248
That never happened, due to "regulatory issues."

00:07:37.582 --> 00:07:41.419
But just like Reddit's data going to OpenAI, a look at the areas

00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:42.712
Altman's wealth is invested

00:07:42.712 --> 00:07:46.090
in show a deep connection to other needs of the organization.

00:07:46.424 --> 00:07:51.345
He's invested in AI networking equipment companies, thermal battery companies,

00:07:51.345 --> 00:07:55.766
and even companies mining the rare earth metals that server farms require.

00:07:56.267 --> 00:08:01.689
And once it's all built, Altman will profit off the problems AI creates.

00:08:02.064 --> 00:08:05.818
We're going to focus on three: Rising energy demands and costs.

00:08:06.027 --> 00:08:08.696
Misuse like fraud and deep fakes.

00:08:08.696 --> 00:08:10.990
And job loss and economic collapse.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:13.576
Altman says

00:08:13.576 --> 00:08:17.497
again and again that OpenAI needs more power.

00:08:17.497 --> 00:08:20.875
The, "audacious long term goal is to build

00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:24.504
250GW of capacity by 2033."

00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:28.049
That much compute will require as much electricity as 1.5

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:31.761
billion people, the equivalent of the entire population of India.

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:36.224
But Altman has a solution: since they first met in the early 2000s,

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:39.268
Peter Thiel and Sam Altman have had a shared interest

00:08:39.268 --> 00:08:42.647
investing in nuclear power, which isn't inherently bad.

00:08:42.688 --> 00:08:45.024
Of course, nuclear can be an extremely efficient

00:08:45.024 --> 00:08:48.861
and clean form of energy, but Thiel and Altman want to own it.

00:08:49.237 --> 00:08:51.989
Altman is invested in Helion and Oklo.

00:08:51.989 --> 00:08:55.910
Helion is working to build the first ever nuclear fusion power plant,

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:59.705
a type of energy creation that many scientists say won't work

00:09:00.081 --> 00:09:01.332
and Oklo is building

00:09:01.332 --> 00:09:05.211
microreactors, literally truck sized nuclear reactors,

00:09:05.253 --> 00:09:08.923
which is a bit concerning considering this investment strategy.

00:09:09.131 --> 00:09:13.302
"Part of our model is make the cost of mistakes really low,

00:09:13.594 --> 00:09:15.263
and then make a lot of mistakes."

00:09:15.263 --> 00:09:18.307
But for now, Oklo hasn't figured their reactors out yet,

00:09:18.307 --> 00:09:21.561
and they're just using gas to keep up the promises they made.

00:09:21.644 --> 00:09:25.231
Nuclear startup Oklo and natural gas firm Liberty Energy today

00:09:25.231 --> 00:09:28.734
announcing a partnership to provide energy to large scale customers.

00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:30.736
Altman is also

00:09:30.736 --> 00:09:34.115
invested in multiple companies offering protection against

00:09:34.115 --> 00:09:38.578
AI bad actors, identity verification to prevent deep fakes, and even companies

00:09:38.578 --> 00:09:42.415
offering insurance for losses due to AI scams and hacking.

00:09:42.748 --> 00:09:46.168
That's like Batman not making any money off of crimefighting,

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:49.755
but then selling "Batmobile drove into my house" insurance

00:09:50.381 --> 00:09:54.427
while also running the Uber for henchman startup that The Riddler uses,

00:09:54.427 --> 00:09:57.430
and selling The Joker white makeup.

00:10:00.057 --> 00:10:00.683
One other

00:10:00.683 --> 00:10:04.520
big promise Altman makes is that when the AI he sees as inevitable

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.479
makes many jobs

00:10:05.479 --> 00:10:09.317
obsolete, it'll create so much wealth that it can be shared with everyone.

00:10:09.317 --> 00:10:14.071
just like his smaller scale Reddit promise that turned out to be bullshit.

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:18.159
And in 2024, he announced the product that would supposedly

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:20.411
offer that shared abundance.

00:10:20.494 --> 00:10:23.289
Worldcoin.

00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:26.667
Worldcoin is a technology company and cryptocurrency

00:10:26.667 --> 00:10:30.296
funded by all the usual suspects of techno fascism.

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:33.674
Worldcoin's backers say it can be a way to give out some form

00:10:33.674 --> 00:10:35.426
of universal basic income.

00:10:35.426 --> 00:10:38.054
When AI starts replacing jobs,

00:10:38.054 --> 00:10:42.308
I think this idea that we have a global currency

00:10:42.308 --> 00:10:45.311
that is outside of the control of any government

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:50.399
is a super logical and important step on the tech tree.

00:10:50.524 --> 00:10:53.027
But it also sells itself as a solution

00:10:53.027 --> 00:10:57.073
to identity verification problems created by AI.

00:10:57.615 --> 00:11:02.244
They want to use these orbs as a method of trusted identity check,

00:11:02.453 --> 00:11:05.581
and you don't get your universal basic income

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:08.751
until you scan your eyes into the orb

00:11:09.085 --> 00:11:12.296
and like many of Altman's other projects, from Loopt to ChatGPT

00:11:12.296 --> 00:11:17.093
it requires universal adoption to be of any business use.

00:11:17.176 --> 00:11:21.138
A currency and identification system are pretty useless if other people don't

00:11:21.138 --> 00:11:24.100
use them. So again, Altman is making an offer.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:27.520
Give us your identity and we'll give you cryptocurrency.

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:29.647
It's a classic Altman deal.

00:11:29.647 --> 00:11:32.525
I'll fix everything if you sign over everything.

00:11:32.525 --> 00:11:34.151
Just trust me, bro.

00:11:34.151 --> 00:11:37.988
It's almost like Altman wants to build a whole other economy.

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:40.991
Just in case the one we have now falls apart.

00:11:40.991 --> 00:11:41.992
Which, well, we'll get to that.

00:11:41.992 --> 00:11:45.621
In 2019, OpenAI gave up any pretense

00:11:45.621 --> 00:11:49.333
of being nonprofit and started a for-profit branch,

00:11:49.583 --> 00:11:53.838
then spun the for-profit out into its own entity in 2024.

00:11:54.171 --> 00:11:57.717
That for-profit organization has none of the same legal

00:11:57.717 --> 00:12:01.637
responsibilities as the nonprofit did, and brought in new investors

00:12:01.637 --> 00:12:05.182
like Microsoft, which invested $13 billion,

00:12:05.391 --> 00:12:09.103
which OpenAI largely spent on Microsoft products.

00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:13.482
And it's not just Microsoft, Nvidia has promised invest 100 billion

00:12:13.482 --> 00:12:17.695
in OpenAI over the next few years, money that OpenAI will spend buying

00:12:17.695 --> 00:12:19.238
Nvidia chips.

00:12:19.238 --> 00:12:22.241
OpenAI has similar circular deals with AMD,

00:12:22.575 --> 00:12:26.078
the Qatari government, and Larry Ellison's Oracle.

00:12:26.287 --> 00:12:29.874
How about the 20 bucks you owe me? Well, I only got ten, so here's ten and I owe you ten.

00:12:29.874 --> 00:12:32.001
Hey, Moe, you owe me 20.

00:12:32.084 --> 00:12:34.253
Well, here's ten, I’ll owe you ten. You owe me 20.

00:12:34.253 --> 00:12:35.045
Here's ten, I’ll owe you ten.

00:12:35.045 --> 00:12:36.756
Here’s the ten I owe you.

00:12:36.756 --> 00:12:37.882
Good. Now we're all even.

00:12:39.091 --> 00:12:39.759
The entire

00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:43.137
economy is tied to the success of Altman's project.

00:12:43.554 --> 00:12:46.682
"We might screw it up, like this is the bet that we're making

00:12:46.682 --> 00:12:50.394
and we're taking a risk along with that." who is the we taking the bet?

00:12:50.561 --> 00:12:52.772
Here's OpenAI's CFO

00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:55.775
Banks, private equity, maybe even,

00:12:56.442 --> 00:12:59.445
governmental,

00:12:59.487 --> 00:13:02.656
the ways governments can come to bear meaning like a federal subsidy or,

00:13:03.115 --> 00:13:05.576
meaning like just first of all, the,

00:13:05.576 --> 00:13:09.288
the backstop, the guarantee that allows the financing to happen.

00:13:09.747 --> 00:13:10.873
Through all of that

00:13:10.873 --> 00:13:14.627
stammering, the CFO of OpenAI is making a clear point:

00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:19.840
The government, your tax dollars, are responsible for saving the AI project.

00:13:20.132 --> 00:13:22.927
That's more eggs

00:13:22.927 --> 00:13:24.386
in the basket.

00:13:24.386 --> 00:13:27.681
And that basket is based on the promises of Sam Altman, who

00:13:27.681 --> 00:13:31.101
as we've illustrated, lies and breaks promises a lot.

00:13:32.311 --> 00:13:34.772
So if we really look

00:13:34.772 --> 00:13:36.065
at the basket,

00:13:36.065 --> 00:13:39.068
maybe we shouldn't have been putting all those eggs in there.

00:13:39.401 --> 00:13:40.528
And it gets worse.

00:13:40.528 --> 00:13:45.574
While we were editing this video, news broke that OpenAI is seeking a $750

00:13:45.574 --> 00:13:48.786
billion valuation and is in talks

00:13:48.786 --> 00:13:51.789
with Amazon for a $10 billion investment.

00:13:52.039 --> 00:13:54.834
That's money that OpenAI would spend on

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:57.837
Amazon infrastructure. So

00:13:58.587 --> 00:14:00.130
I'm going to need more eggs.
