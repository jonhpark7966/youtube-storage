2026-01-17 00:08:59,500 - INFO -   | [04:10.440 --> 04:14.980]  were you just using like a simple like two-layer mlp for like these frontier sort of you know state
2026-01-17 00:08:59,500 - INFO -   | [04:14.980 --> 04:21.760]  of the rl algorithms um and so i was very curious like can we design rl algorithms can we sort of put
2026-01-17 00:08:59,500 - INFO -   | [04:21.760 --> 04:27.420]  together a recipe for rl that can allow it to scale in potentially you know analogous ways that
2026-01-17 00:08:59,500 - INFO -   | [04:27.420 --> 04:32.800]  language envisioned my skill and so what we did is that we know that traditional rl like let's say
2026-01-17 00:08:59,500 - INFO -   | [04:32.800 --> 04:36.580]  like value value-based rl doesn't really scale right this is pretty clear from the literature
2026-01-17 00:08:59,500 - INFO -   | [04:36.580 --> 04:41.980]  so we tried a different approach of rl um called self-supervised rl where instead of learning like a
2026-01-17 00:08:59,500 - INFO -   | [04:41.980 --> 04:47.260]  value function we're learning representations of states actions and future states such that the

2026-01-17 00:08:59,500 - INFO -   | [04:56.360 --> 05:01.060]  learn in a self-supervised manner so there's we can solve task reach goals without any human
2026-01-17 00:08:59,500 - INFO -   | [05:01.060 --> 05:05.220]  crafted reward single and so we know that self-supervised learning is scalable in these

2026-01-17 00:08:59,500 - INFO -   | [05:11.080 --> 05:15.540]  first tried it it actually didn't work like we've made the networks deeper the performance like totally
2026-01-17 00:08:59,500 - INFO -   | [05:15.540 --> 05:22.000]  degraded but then we also but then i separately was like there's also some other work like um in in
2026-01-17 00:08:59,500 - INFO -   | [05:22.000 --> 05:26.340]  our literature like we tried like residual connections uh and it is other a few other

2026-01-17 00:08:59,500 - INFO -   | [05:30.880 --> 05:35.060]  like i ran this experiment and there was like this one environment in which there was like
2026-01-17 00:08:59,500 - INFO -   | [05:35.060 --> 05:39.720]  like going from like like doubling the depth didn't really do anything but like doubling the depth again
2026-01-17 00:08:59,500 - INFO -   | [05:40.160 --> 05:44.980]  with these different components suddenly like skyrocketed performance in this one environment
2026-01-17 00:08:59,500 - INFO -   | [05:44.980 --> 05:49.700]  getting this to work was very non-trivial in the sense that like usually when we think about doing

2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [05:55.100 --> 06:00.480]  it makes it better and if we just made the depth bigger makes it worse we just had residual connections
2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [06:00.480 --> 06:04.980]  didn't make it better and it was really this combination of factors that kevin and sean figured
2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [06:04.980 --> 06:09.820]  out that really made this work and as a precursor to that we also try scaling along different dimensions
2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [06:09.820 --> 06:15.140]  so scaling the batch size uh scaling the the width of the network so the hidden layers in effect
2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [06:15.860 --> 06:20.680]  yeah pretty much kind of similar to just scaling depth naively yeah um and then once we started
2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [06:20.680 --> 06:25.400]  introducing residual connections layer norm these specific architectural choices that's when we saw

2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [06:36.900 --> 06:42.700]  as opposed to scaling just along with which did yield some performance improvements um but when you
2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [06:42.700 --> 06:47.660]  look at the number of parameters that your network has as you grow with it's roughly a quadratic as
2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [06:47.660 --> 06:51.700]  opposed to something like growing depth so it's more in some sense it's more parameter efficient also
2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [06:51.700 --> 06:57.020]  more sample efficient from the experiments that we conducted nice um in some ways you're sort of
2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [06:57.020 --> 07:03.660]  replicating stuff that is seen in the wild but on on a very small model that you can study is that would
2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [07:03.660 --> 07:07.760]  you would you say that's yeah so i kind of add to what kevin said earlier we saw these huge performance
2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [07:07.760 --> 07:12.440]  improvements in language models image generation models by making them larger making them deeper
2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [07:12.440 --> 07:18.700]  which seems very intuitive yeah and so that's why our work we draw from like foundational research
2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [07:18.700 --> 07:24.740]  right like uh residual networks which employ residual connections to avoid uh vanishing gradients and
2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [07:24.740 --> 07:28.000]  that's something that we show in some of our ablations in our in our paper further down
2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [07:28.000 --> 07:32.120]  it's probably in the appendices where you did experiments without these residual connections
2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [07:32.120 --> 07:37.260]  and so it's sort of borrowing these concepts that have existed in other fields and applying them
2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [07:37.260 --> 07:43.040]  to this setting with uh rl and showing that it works before ben has to have to go i'll leave the sort
2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [07:43.040 --> 07:49.560]  of last word uh to him what additional work does this inspire that like that you want to push on next i think
2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [07:49.560 --> 07:53.880]  there's one thing i'd clarify about the paper and then i'll directly answer the question yes i think
2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [07:53.880 --> 07:57.800]  the thing i might clarify about the paper is i think a lot of people reading the title are like wow big networks
2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [07:57.800 --> 08:01.700]  they're great i'll take big networks you solved it now we can just go yeah just take big networks
2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [08:01.700 --> 08:06.560]  add them to ppo add them to sac add them to your favorite reinforcement learning algorithm but i think
2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [08:06.560 --> 08:11.060]  that's actually not the main conclusion i think the main conclusion is that using big networks not only
2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [08:11.060 --> 08:16.240]  requires these architectural tricks but also as kevin mentioned before it requires using a different
2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [08:16.240 --> 08:22.280]  objective this objective doesn't actually use rewards in it and so there's another word in the
2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [08:22.280 --> 08:27.460]  title reinforcement learning that also might be a little bit of a misnomer because we aren't

2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [08:32.580 --> 08:37.440]  here and so is at the end of the day this a reinforcement learning method i don't know
2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [08:37.440 --> 08:43.060]  it looks much more similar to the self-supervised methods in other areas of machine learning and so i
2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [08:43.060 --> 08:47.980]  think that the method the work really stands in some sort of interesting intersection of reinforcement
2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [08:47.980 --> 08:55.160]  learning and self-supervised learning research and we had this little figure on the bottom left of

2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [09:05.880 --> 09:10.560]  reinforcement learning and i think what our paper really suggests is that the boundary between these
2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [09:10.560 --> 09:14.240]  things is really blurry and maybe the keys to building intelligent systems are going to be leveraging

2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [09:21.660 --> 09:27.760]  soon yeah thank you so much for coming i think that that insight of like blurring things is interesting
2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [09:27.760 --> 09:32.520]  i don't know if you like you were talking about so like uh the abstraction layer of representation
2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [09:32.520 --> 09:38.440]  learning i don't know if that triggers anything in terms of like the mix between self-supervised and
2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [09:38.440 --> 09:42.740]  reinforcement learning is that is there something fundamental that you've discovered or that we've
2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [09:42.740 --> 09:47.260]  that people don't understand when they when they read the paper yeah i think the best way that i would
2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [09:47.260 --> 09:53.680]  explain it is that we know that standard rl is not super scalable and so like why can this a different
2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [09:53.680 --> 09:58.220]  approach or different objective rl be scalable i think it's because we're fundamentally shifting the
2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [09:58.780 --> 10:04.240]  burden of learning from something like like q learning or like regressing to like td errors which

2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [10:24.700 --> 10:30.660]  and like some of the objectives there so in some sense we're kind of blurring the the lines we're

2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [10:45.280 --> 10:49.500]  vision that we know have scaled so much and so i think yeah i think that's like one of the fundamental
2026-01-17 00:09:05,534 - INFO -   | [10:49.500 --> 10:55.400]  insights that we've seen is that um it seems like by approaching rl in this different approach we're

2026-01-17 00:09:11,481 - INFO -   | [11:44.460 --> 11:50.000]  and and performance follow the the scale i think that's something that we should uh probably mine deeper
2026-01-17 00:09:11,481 - INFO -   | [11:50.000 --> 11:56.000]  um do you think i guess like what domains what industry like you've applied it on multiple different
2026-01-17 00:09:11,481 - INFO -   | [11:56.000 --> 12:01.820]  uh types of networks that are or data sets is there a particular affinity that you think like has is
2026-01-17 00:09:11,481 - INFO -   | [12:01.820 --> 12:07.080]  like kind of low-hanging food yeah so actually if you look at a lot of our tasks they're particularly
2026-01-17 00:09:11,481 - INFO -   | [12:07.080 --> 12:13.780]  sort of like robotics tasks um so this is a person i'd be very curious about how a work like this could

2026-01-17 00:09:11,481 - INFO -   | [13:16.320 --> 13:21.740]  the very deep the deeper it is there should be quadratically worse i am not familiar with like
2026-01-17 00:09:11,481 - INFO -   | [13:21.740 --> 13:28.420]  the the pre-existing literature i'm just like sort of working out intuitions but um basically uh what
2026-01-17 00:09:11,481 - INFO -   | [13:28.420 --> 13:33.640]  are the trade-offs that you've found that i think you might want to warn people about because because you
2026-01-17 00:09:11,481 - INFO -   | [13:33.640 --> 13:37.680]  you are the guy who mentioned efficiency so yeah sure sure yeah so i was referring to like one of the
2026-01-17 00:09:11,481 - INFO -   | [13:37.680 --> 13:42.480]  figures on our poster also in our paper where we compare like the number of parameters that models have

2026-01-17 00:09:11,481 - INFO -   | [13:47.480 --> 13:53.320]  architecture the most baseline one would be like a width of 256 like the hidden layers of 256 neurons
2026-01-17 00:09:11,481 - INFO -   | [13:53.320 --> 13:59.040]  and then the depth is for four layers or hidden layers um and so the point i was making there is
2026-01-17 00:09:11,481 - INFO -   | [13:59.040 --> 14:02.820]  that when you scale along depth your the number of parameters that your model has is going to grow
2026-01-17 00:09:11,481 - INFO -   | [14:02.820 --> 14:10.080]  roughly linearly uh whereas with with you're making your network outputs wider and then the input to the net
2026-01-17 00:09:11,481 - INFO -   | [14:10.080 --> 14:14.480]  next network is also growing as well and so the the number of parameters your network's then going
2026-01-17 00:09:11,481 - INFO -   | [14:14.480 --> 14:19.160]  to have grows approximately quadratically and so one of the experiments we did was sort of examining
2026-01-17 00:09:11,481 - INFO -   | [14:19.680 --> 14:23.520]  as we grow the number of parameters in our model by scaling along these two different choices

2026-01-17 00:09:11,481 - INFO -   | [14:29.140 --> 14:33.900]  curve kind of goes like this it jumps up pretty fast that's like present throughout our paper for with
2026-01-17 00:09:11,481 - INFO -   | [14:33.900 --> 14:38.220]  it grows a little bit more slowly and so that the kind of takeaway from that is that if you
2026-01-17 00:09:11,481 - INFO -   | [14:38.220 --> 14:42.180]  are a bit more resource constrained scaling along depth might be better because there's fewer
2026-01-17 00:09:11,481 - INFO -   | [14:42.180 --> 14:47.380]  parameters with a smaller model to a smaller number tool learnable parameters width is expensive

2026-01-17 00:09:11,481 - INFO -   | [14:51.600 --> 14:56.740]  expensive so that's just like another consideration to think about when using these networks and suppose
2026-01-17 00:09:11,481 - INFO -   | [14:56.740 --> 15:01.400]  yeah any other sort of rules of thumbs like that that i can extract that this is just the most basic
2026-01-17 00:09:11,481 - INFO -   | [15:01.400 --> 15:07.140]  one that i could think of yeah uh i don't know if there's any others yeah i guess like your original
2026-01-17 00:09:11,481 - INFO -   | [15:07.140 --> 15:11.180]  question of like the trade-offs um like one of the trade-offs one of the limitations that we say is
2026-01-17 00:09:11,481 - INFO -   | [15:11.180 --> 15:17.100]  like obviously if you make the networks bigger the it will take longer to run right so if you like
2026-01-17 00:09:11,481 - INFO -   | [15:17.100 --> 15:21.820]  double the depth at some level of depth you you it might take like twice as much to like take make a

2026-01-17 00:09:11,481 - INFO -   | [16:24.000 --> 16:29.280]  yeah that's like work they've been called okay and you i don't know if you want to explore expand upon
2026-01-17 00:09:11,481 - INFO -   | [16:29.280 --> 16:34.340]  that on the jargon zcrl uh maybe and you know most people are familiar with pytor is maybe less

2026-01-17 00:09:17,840 - INFO -   | [17:05.240 --> 17:11.580]  other so going back to our paper if you look at the plots we only see this like huge performance
2026-01-17 00:09:17,840 - INFO -   | [17:11.580 --> 17:21.100]  increase when we cross like 50 uh millions of uh transitions uh gap so so i think the data is crucial
2026-01-17 00:09:17,840 - INFO -   | [17:21.100 --> 17:27.240]  like here yeah i guess even to build on that like i like drawing analogies to like successes in other

2026-01-17 00:09:17,840 - INFO -   | [19:11.340 --> 19:16.380]  see that there are some like sort of parallels here that perhaps we should dig into deeper and
2026-01-17 00:09:17,840 - INFO -   | [19:16.380 --> 19:22.440]  see like what is the core to of what enables deep learning to scale and then how can we like leverage
2026-01-17 00:09:17,840 - INFO -   | [19:22.440 --> 19:26.800]  that how can we distill those like insights and then apply those across like all different fields

2026-01-17 00:09:17,841 - INFO -   | [22:28.360 --> 22:35.240]  would i'm very curious of like can we like what's the like real like can we push i'm i'm curious about
2026-01-17 00:09:17,841 - INFO -   | [22:35.240 --> 22:39.940]  like advancing the frontier as much as possible um so if you actually look at our paper we focus on
2026-01-17 00:09:17,841 - INFO -   | [22:39.940 --> 22:44.100]  scaling depth but we notice that we see that scaling width actually also improves performance
2026-01-17 00:09:17,841 - INFO -   | [22:44.100 --> 22:49.100]  and we also find that actually by scaling depth we actually unlock the ability to scale along batch
2026-01-17 00:09:17,841 - INFO -   | [22:49.100 --> 22:55.760]  size as well um so this is uh one of yeah so okay it's like a collinear like yeah right so like
2026-01-17 00:09:23,352 - INFO -   | [22:55.760 --> 23:00.180]  okay i guess for context like in traditional rl like value-based rl scaling batch size is not super
2026-01-17 00:09:23,352 - INFO -   | [23:00.180 --> 23:04.520]  effective but there's we also can see there's also other work in other areas of deep learning that

2026-01-17 00:09:23,352 - INFO -   | [23:13.480 --> 23:18.220]  perhaps so one hypothesis and i'd be like perhaps the reason why scale batches isn't that effective
2026-01-17 00:09:23,352 - INFO -   | [23:18.220 --> 23:21.540]  in traditional rls because like we've been using these tiny networks that haven't been able to
